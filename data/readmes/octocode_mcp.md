Octocode is not just a tool; it's a methodology and a platform that transforms how AI interacts with code. It moves AI from "guessing" based on training data to "knowing" based on deep, evidence-based research.

This repository contains the complete ecosystem that powers this transformation.

## 📜 The Manifest

**"Code is Truth, but Context is the Map."**

At the heart of Octocode lies the **Manifest for Research Driven Development (RDD)**.

👉 **Read the full manifest here: [MANIFEST.md](./MANIFEST.md)**

The Manifest defines a new philosophy for AI coding:
- **Vibe-Research**: Enabling AI to intuitively explore code like a human.
- **Evidence First**: No line of code is written without proof it's needed and correct.
- **Adversarial Validation**: AI agents check each other's work (Planner vs. Verifier) to ensure quality.

It answers the question: *How can we trust AI to build complex software?* By forcing it to research before it acts.

## 🔌 The MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**The Eyes and Hands of Octocode.**

The **Octocode MCP Server** (`packages/octocode-mcp`) is the bridge between your AI (like Claude or Cursor) and the world of code. It acts as the engine that powers the research.

- **GitHub Tools**: Search millions of repositories, find usage patterns, and read real-world implementations.
- **Local Tools**: Explore your local codebase with filesystem access.
- **LSP Intelligence**: "Go to Definition", "Find References", and "Call Hierarchy" — giving AI the semantic understanding of a compiler.

The MCP Server provides the *capabilities* to see, touch, and understand code structure.

## 🧠 The Skill

**The Brain of the Operation.**

> **[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills)** are a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows.

Octocode is supported in both MCP and as a skill!

It adds specialized capabilities **out-of-the-box (OOTB)**:
1.  **Correct Prompts**: Auto-injects the Research Driven Development system prompts.
2.  **Advanced Planning**: Breaks down complex problems into specific research questions.
3.  **Deep Research**: Orchestrates the right MCP tools in the right order (e.g., Search → Go to Definition → Read).
4.  **Parallel Agents**: Handles spawning sub-agents for parallel execution of research tasks.

This skill turns a generic AI model into a specialized **Research Architect**.

> **💡 Tip**: Ask Octocode to "roast your code" and you will get a surprise! 🔥🎭

Octocode comes with a powerful CLI to manage your agent's capabilities.

```bash
npx octocode-cli
```

It handles:
- **Authentication**: Easy GitHub OAuth setup.
- **Installations**: One-click setup for MCP servers and Skills.
- **Management**: Interactive menu for all Octocode features.
