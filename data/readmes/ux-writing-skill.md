An Agent Skill that enables Claude and OpenAI Codex to write and edit user-centered interface copy (UX text/microcopy) for digital products. This skill transforms AI assistants into specialized UX writing tools that apply consistent standards, patterns, and voice across your product.

## The Problem

Design systems solve visual consistency, but content quality still depends on individual writers. Every error message, button label, and empty state requires manual review to ensure it's clear, concise, conversational, and purposeful. This doesn't scale.

## The Solution

This Agent Skill packages UX writing expertise into a system that Claude can apply automatically. Instead of asking "make this better," you can rely on consistent, evidence-based improvements across your entire product interface.

## What Makes This Different

**Systems thinking, not style guides**: This isn't a list of writing tips. It's a framework for evaluating and improving UX text based on four measurable quality standards.

**Progressive disclosure**: Reference materials are loaded only when needed, keeping Claude's context efficient while providing deep expertise on demand.

**Proven patterns**: Built from real-world UX writing best practices, with examples across different product voices and contexts.

**Immediately actionable**: Every pattern includes concrete before/after examples and scoring against quality standards.

## What You Get

### Core Framework
- **Four quality standards**: Purposeful, Concise, Conversational, Clear
- **Common UX patterns**: Buttons, errors, empty states, forms, notifications, onboarding
- **Editing process**: Systematic approach to improving any interface text
- **Voice and tone guidance**: Adapt content to brand personality and context
- **Accessibility guidelines**: Write for screen readers, cognitive accessibility, and WCAG compliance
- **Research-backed benchmarks**: Sentence length targets, comprehension rates, reading levels

### Reference Materials
- **Accessibility guidelines**: Comprehensive guide for writing inclusive, accessible UX text
- **Voice chart template**: Establish consistent brand personality
- **Content usability checklist**: Evaluate text quality with scoring framework
- **Detailed pattern examples**: See how different voices apply the same patterns

### Practical Tools
- **Real-world improvements**: Before/after transformations with analysis
- **Fillable templates**: Error messages, empty states, onboarding flows
- **Expanded error patterns**: Validation, system, blocking, and permission errors with examples
- **Tone adaptation framework**: Map emotional states to appropriate tone
- **Quick reference**: Common patterns and anti-patterns

## Use Cases

**For content designers**: Apply consistent UX writing standards across your product without memorizing every rule.

**For product teams**: Enable non-writers to create interface copy that follows your design system.

**For design system teams**: Enforce content guidelines at scale without becoming a bottleneck.

**For early-stage products**: Build content quality in from the start with proven patterns.

## Installation

### What You Need

This skill works with **Claude Desktop**, **Claude Code**, and **Codex** (CLI and IDE extensions). Choose the installation method that matches your setup.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```
Write an error message for when a payment fails
```

Claude applies the skill automatically and generates clear, actionable error messages following best practices.

### Editing Existing Copy

```
Review this button label: "Submit your information for processing"
```

Claude evaluates against the four quality standards and suggests improvements.

### Creating Consistent Patterns

```
Create empty state copy for a task list, keeping voice consistent with:
- Purposeful, Concise, Conversational, Clear
- Professional but friendly tone
```

Claude applies the appropriate patterns and maintains voice consistency.

### Evaluating Quality

```
Score this error message:
"An error occurred. Please try again later."
```

Claude uses the content usability checklist to provide detailed scoring and improvement suggestions.

## How It Works

This skill uses **model-invoked activation** — Claude and Codex automatically decide when to use it based on your request. You don't need to explicitly call the skill; it activates when you:

- Write or edit interface copy
- Create error messages, notifications, or empty states
- Work on button labels, form fields, or instructions
- Review product content for consistency
- Establish voice and tone guidelines

The AI loads reference materials progressively, using only what's needed for your specific task to maintain efficient context usage.

**In Codex CLI/IDE**, you can also explicitly invoke the skill using `$ux-writing` or through the `/skills` command.

## What You'll Learn

Using this skill exposes the systematic thinking behind effective UX writing:

- How to evaluate content objectively with scoring frameworks
- Why certain patterns work across different product contexts
- How voice stays consistent while tone adapts to situations
- The difference between writing for clarity vs. writing for personality

## For Content Design Teams

This skill can serve as:

- **Onboarding tool**: New team members learn patterns faster
- **Quality baseline**: Consistent standards across all writers
- **Efficiency multiplier**: Generate first drafts that follow guidelines
- **System documentation**: Reference materials that never go stale

### Building the Skill Package

If you're contributing or want to build the skill ZIP locally:

```bash
./build-skill.sh
```

This creates `dist/ux-writing-skill.zip` containing only the skill files (`SKILL.md`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `references/`, `templates/`).

The build script excludes repository files like `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `index.html`, and the demo video — these live on GitHub but aren't needed in the skill package.
