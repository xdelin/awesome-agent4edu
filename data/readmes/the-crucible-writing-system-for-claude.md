# Crucible Suite

A Claude Code plugin for writing epic fantasy novels using the Crucible Structure--a 36-beat narrative framework with three interwoven story strands.

## Overview

Crucible Suite guides authors through the complete novel-writing process:

1. **Planning** - Interactive questionnaire generates 9 comprehensive planning documents
2. **Outlining** - Transform planning documents into detailed chapter-by-chapter outlines
3. **Writing** - Scene-by-scene drafting with style matching and anti-hallucination protocols
4. **Editing** - Multi-level revision from developmental editing to final polish

## Features

## The Crucible Structure

### Three Strands

- **Quest Strand** - The external mission, burden, or objective
- **Fire Strand** - Internal power, curse, or transformation
- **Constellation Strand** - Relationships, community, bonds that anchor or break

### Six Movements

| Movement | Name | % of Book | Function |
|----------|------|-----------|----------|
| I | Ignition | 10% | Light the forge |
| II | First Tempering | 20% | Shape through failure |
| III | Scattering | 25% | Expand, harden, fragment |
| IV | Brightest Burning | 25% | Master, gather, choose |
| V | Final Forging | 15% | Converge, fail, transcend |
| Coda | Tempered Blade | 5% | Reveal what was made |

### Forge Points

Critical moments where all three strands collide:

| Forge Point | Location | Function |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Ignition Forge | ~10% (Beat 6) | Threshold destroyed; no return |
| First Crucible | ~25% (Beat 11) | All strands in crisis; one sacrificed |
| Second Crucible | ~50% (Beat 21) | Harder choice, higher stakes |
| Third Crucible | ~75% (Beat 28) | Deepest sacrifice before finale |
| Apex Willed Surrender | ~90% (Beat 33) | Essential thing given up by choice |

## Review Agents

Five specialized agents analyze your prose during bi-chapter reviews:

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **voice-checker** | Style and voice consistency |
| **continuity-checker** | Plot and character continuity |
| **outline-checker** | Adherence to chapter outlines |
| **timeline-checker** | Chronological consistency |
| **prose-checker** | Craft-level feedback |

## Planning Documents

The planning phase generates 9 documents:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Crucible Thesis** | Core forging question and strand summaries |
| **Quest Strand Map** | External mission beats and progression |
| **Fire Strand Map** | Internal transformation arc |
| **Constellation Strand Map** | Relationship dynamics and bonds |
| **Forge Points** | Detailed convergence scenes (5 files) |
| **Dark Mirror Profile** | Antagonist as shadow of protagonist |
| **Constellation Bible** | Character relationships and dynamics |
| **Mercy Ledger** | Acts of mercy that pay off in climax |
| **World Forge** | Worldbuilding tied to theme |

## Project Structure

When you start a Crucible project, it creates:

```
your-project/
+-- CLAUDE.md                    # Project memory
+-- .crucible/
|   +-- state/
|       +-- planning-state.json  # Session state
+-- planning/
    +-- CLAUDE.md                # Planning context
    +-- strand-maps/             # Generated strand documents
    +-- forge-points/            # Forge point details
```

As you progress through phases, additional directories are created:

```
+-- outline/                     # Added during outlining
|   +-- CLAUDE.md
|   +-- by-chapter/
+-- draft/                       # Added during writing
|   +-- CLAUDE.md
|   +-- chapters/
+-- story-bible.json             # Generated during writing
+-- style-profile.json           # Captured from samples
```

## Requirements

- Claude Code (latest version recommended)
- Python 3.8+ (for automation scripts)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Crucible Suite for non-fantasy genres?**
A: The 36-beat structure works well for any genre with strong character arcs. The terminology is fantasy-flavored, but the underlying principles--external goal, internal transformation, relationship dynamics--are universal.

**Q: How long should my novel be?**
A: Crucible Suite is optimized for epic fantasy (120,000-180,000 words). The 36 beats map to approximately 40-50 chapters at 3,000-4,000 words each.

**Q: Can I modify the beat structure?**
A: The planning documents you generate are fully editable. Adjust beat placement, merge beats, or split them as needed for your story.

**Q: What if I already have a partial draft?**
A: Use `/crucible-suite:crucible-continue` to detect your project state. You can generate planning documents retroactively or start outlining from any point.

**Q: How do bi-chapter reviews work?**
A: Every two chapters, the system automatically runs five review agents (voice, continuity, outline, timeline, prose) to catch issues early. You can also trigger reviews manually with `/crucible-suite:crucible-review`.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Commands not recognized** | Ensure plugin is installed: check `~/.claude/plugins/crucible-suite/` exists |
| **Python scripts fail** | Verify Python 3.8+ is installed and in PATH |
| **Session state lost** | Run `/crucible-suite:crucible-restore` to recover from automatic backups |
| **Review agents timeout** | Large chapters may need more time; break into smaller scenes |
| **Planning seems stuck** | Use `/crucible-suite:crucible-status` to check progress, `/crucible-suite:crucible-continue` to resume |
