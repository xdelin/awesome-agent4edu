Transform Claude into your AI-powered productivity partner. A collection of skills that make Claude an active participant in your personal knowledge management, task tracking, and daily workflows.

## 🎯 What is This?

Instead of just asking Claude questions, these skills make Claude an **active partner** in managing your work:

- 📝 **Capture knowledge** conversationally across any project
- 🔍 **Search your notes** naturally with AI understanding  
- 🔗 **Surface connections** between ideas you've forgotten
- 📊 **Recognize patterns** in your work over time
- 💡 **Get insights** from your accumulated knowledge

All while keeping your data local in simple markdown files.

*Claude automatically finds and connects related notes across sessions, showing the progression from idea to implementation*

## ✨ Quick Start (2 Minutes)

**Claude Code:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add mcdow-webworks/productivity-skills
/plugin install productivity-suite@productivity-skills
```

Then say: `"Note that I just discovered a great caching solution"`

**That's it!** See [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for details and troubleshooting.

> **Note:** Claude Desktop support is not yet available. The current implementation uses the Claude Code Skills system. Support for Claude Desktop via MCP server is in planning phase.

## 🚀 Available Skills

### 📝 Note-Taking (Available Now)

Transform markdown notes into an AI-navigable knowledge system. Claude becomes your interface for capturing, organizing, and retrieving information.

**Key Features:**
- Conversational note capture from any project
- Intelligent search across all your notes  
- Automatic updates to existing entries
- Pattern recognition and insight generation
- Maintains simple markdown format

[Full Note-Taking Guide →](docs/note-taking-guide.md)

**Example Usage:**
```
You: "Note that the German partner loved the llms.txt idea"
Claude: Added to November notes! I also found your earlier llms.txt
        entry from Nov 15.

You: "What's the status of llms.txt?"
Claude: You have 3 entries showing progression from concept to
        validated to implementation. Ready to move forward?
```

## 💡 Why Skills?

### Traditional Approach
```
You: "Can you remember that I prefer TypeScript?"
Claude: "I'll try to remember that..."
[Next session: Claude has forgotten]
```

### With Productivity Skills
```
You: "Note that our team prefers TypeScript for new projects"
Claude: Added to your November notes!

[Days later, different session]
You: "What language should I use for this new API?"
Claude: Based on your Nov 12 note, your team prefers TypeScript.
        Should I use that?
```

**Skills provide:**
- ✅ Persistent memory across sessions
- ✅ Searchable knowledge base
- ✅ Pattern recognition over time
- ✅ Cross-project availability
- ✅ Plain text portability

## 📖 Philosophy

These skills follow core principles:

1. **Plain text first** - All data in markdown, portable forever
2. **AI-navigable** - Claude as interface, not just storage
3. **Natural interaction** - Talk naturally, not commands
4. **Cross-project** - Available in every Claude session
5. **Local-first** - Your data stays on your machine
6. **Incremental adoption** - Start simple, grow organically

Inspired by:
- ["Your Second Brain = AI's Interface"](https://jkudish.com/newsletter/003) by Joey Kudish
- Building a Second Brain methodology
- Plain text productivity systems

## 🎮 Example Workflows

### Knowledge Worker

```bash
# Morning
cd ~/projects/api-service
claude

You: "What did I note about the authentication refactor?"
Claude: Shows 3 entries from last week with evolution of thinking

# During work
You: "Note that we decided to use JWT with refresh tokens"
Claude: Added! I also found your earlier auth discussion from last week.

# Evening  
You: "What should I remember from today?"
Claude: You made progress on auth, fixed caching bug, and had
        the partner demo. Worth noting any insights?
```

### Developer

```bash
cd ~/projects/web-app
claude

You: "I just solved that React rendering issue"
Claude: Great! Want me to note the solution so you remember
        this approach for future projects?

You: "Yes - it was the useEffect dependency array"
Claude: Added technical note with code example

[Weeks later, different project]
You: "I'm seeing weird React renders again"
Claude: I found your note from Nov 17 about useEffect dependencies.
        Is this the same issue?
```

### Product Manager

```bash
You: "Note that the Q4 roadmap was approved with 3 major features"
Claude: Added to November notes

You: "Connect this to our earlier product vision discussion"  
Claude: Linked! The approved features align well with your 
        October vision note about AI integration

You: "What themes emerged in my product notes this month?"
Claude: Analyzing 23 entries... Three main themes:
        1. AI/ML integration (8 entries)
        2. User feedback incorporation (6 entries)  
        3. Performance optimization (5 entries)
```
