### SKILL.md Format

Your `SKILL.md` is what Claude reads to understand your skill. Follow this structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what the skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Name - Brief Description

One-paragraph overview of what this skill does.

## Quick Start

Minimal steps to get started (2-5 minutes max).

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Primary Feature
Description and examples

### 2. Secondary Feature
Description and examples

## How It Works

Behind-the-scenes explanation.

## Best Practices

Tips for effective use.

## Configuration Options

Optional customizations.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions.
```

**Key principles for SKILL.md:**

1. **YAML frontmatter required** - Must include `name` and `description` fields
2. **Clear and concise** - Claude reads this, so be direct
3. **Example-driven** - Show don't tell
4. **Conversational triggers** - Explain what phrases activate features
5. **Error handling** - Document edge cases
6. **Integration patterns** - How it works with other skills

### Example SKILL.md Snippet

```markdown
---
name: task-management
description: Track tasks conversationally with automatic prioritization and context awareness. Use when managing todos, tracking work items, or organizing tasks.
---

# Task Management - AI-Assisted Todo Tracking

Track tasks conversationally with automatic prioritization and context awareness.

## Quick Start

1. Create tasks directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/tasks
   ```

2. Start using:
   ```
   "Add task: Review pull requests"
   ```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Adding Tasks

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Add task..."
- "Todo: ..."
- "Remember to..."

**Example:**
```
You: "Add task: Review the API documentation by Friday"
Claude: Added high-priority task with deadline Nov 22.
```

### 2. Listing Tasks

**Trigger phrases:**
- "What's on my todo list?"
- "Show my tasks"
- "What should I work on?"

**Example:**
```
You: "What should I work on today?"
Claude: You have 3 high-priority tasks:
        1. Review API docs (due Friday)
        2. Fix caching bug (no deadline)
        3. Customer demo prep (due tomorrow)
```
```

### Supporting Scripts

If your skill needs Python/Bash scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Brief description of what this script does.
Part of productivity-skills/your-skill-name
"""

import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Configuration
SKILL_DIR = Path.home() / ".your-skill"

def main():
    """Main entry point"""
    # Read input from stdin
    try:
        data = json.load(sys.stdin)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        data = {}
    
    # Process command
    command = data.get('command', 'help')
    
    # Execute and return JSON
    result = {'status': 'success'}
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
    return 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main())
```

**Script guidelines:**
- Use Python 3.7+ (widely available)
- Accept JSON via stdin
- Output JSON to stdout
- Use stderr for errors
- Include helpful error messages
- Make scripts executable (`chmod +x`)

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### README.md

User-facing documentation should:
- Start with clear value proposition
- Include quick start (< 5 minutes)
- Provide usage examples
- Show common workflows
- Link to related resources

### Comments and Docstrings

```python
def search_tasks(query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Search for tasks matching query.
    
    Args:
        query: Search terms
        max_results: Maximum number of results to return
    
    Returns:
        List of matching tasks with relevance scores
        
    Example:
        >>> search_tasks("review api")
        [{"title": "Review API docs", "priority": "high"}]
    """
    pass
```

### Inline Documentation

```markdown
## Advanced Configuration

You can customize the task directory:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
export TASKS_DIR="$HOME/Documents/tasks"
```

This is useful when:
- You want tasks in a synced folder
- Multiple users share a system
- You're organizing by project
```
```

## 🎨 Code Style

### Python

Follow PEP 8 with these specifics:
- 4 spaces for indentation
- Max line length: 100 characters
- Type hints where helpful
- Docstrings for public functions

```python
def add_task(title: str, priority: str = "medium") -> Dict:
    """Add a new task with optional priority."""
    pass
```

### Markdown

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`)
- Code blocks with language specifiers
- Lists with consistent style
- One sentence per line (for diffs)

### JSON

```json
{
  "key": "value",
  "nested": {
    "property": "formatted"
  }
}
```

2-space indentation, trailing commas allowed.
