## [1.0.17] - 2025-12-20

### Changed

#### Repository Restructure
- Moved plugin from `plugin/crucible-suite/` to repository root
  - Plugin components now directly at root level for simpler installation
  - Removed nested plugin path from all documentation
- Merged `plugin-update` branch into `main`
  - All development work from v1.0.1 through v1.0.16 now on main branch
  - Installation URL simplified: no longer requires `#plugin-update` branch reference

#### README Accuracy Overhaul
- Changed "7 planning documents" to "9 planning documents" (accurate count)
- Added new "Planning Documents" section listing all 9 documents with purposes
- Fixed Forge Points section:
  - Changed "Five Forge Points" to "Four Forge Points + Apex"
  - Added beat numbers and locations for each forge point

  - Accurately shows what directories exist at each phase
- Updated skill reference file lists to include all files:
  - crucible-planner: added `question-key-mapping.md`
  - crucible-writer: added `bi-chapter-review.md`, `story-bible-commands.md`
- Removed emoji characters (ASCII-only per project guidelines)
- Changed Unicode tree characters to ASCII (`+--` instead of special chars)

### Removed

#### Development Files
- Removed from repository root (archived locally):
  - `CC Plugins/` - Plugin documentation reference
  - `Claude Skills/` - Original skill files
  - `docs/` - Framework documentation
  - `Example Chapters/` - Sample content
  - `GAP-ANALYSIS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, `USER-FLOW-DIAGRAMS.md`
- These were development/reference files, not part of the plugin itself

## [1.0.16] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

#### Review Agent Model Configuration
- Fixed invalid model ID in outline-checker and timeline-checker agents
  - Changed from non-existent `claude-haiku-4-20250514` to valid `haiku` shorthand
  - Agents were failing with "model configuration error" due to 404 API responses
  - Both agents now correctly use the haiku model for fast review checks

## [1.0.15] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

#### Planning Completion in /crucible-continue Command
- Fixed command not verifying actual planning files exist before reporting "Planning COMPLETE"
  - Root cause: Command only read state JSON, didn't check if compile_documents.py had run
  - Added "CRITICAL: Planning Completion Check" section to command instructions
  - Claude now must verify `planning/crucible-thesis.md` exists before declaring planning complete
  - If Q&A done but files missing, offers to run compilation script
- This complements the v1.0.14 fix to detect_project.py with instructions for the command itself

## [1.0.14] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

#### Planning Completion Detection
- Fixed `/crucible-continue` incorrectly reporting planning as complete when document files were never generated
  - Root cause: `detect_project.py` only checked if 9 Q&A sessions were marked complete in state JSON
  - Did not verify that `compile_documents.py` had actually run to generate the planning files
  - Now requires BOTH conditions: Q&A complete (9/9 docs) AND `planning/crucible-thesis.md` exists
- Added `planning_files_exist()` helper function to verify compiled documents exist
- Added diagnostic fields to progress output: `qa_complete` and `files_generated`
- Updated `get_resume_point()` to detect and report the "compile needed" state
  - New message: "Q&A complete (9/9 docs). Run compile_documents.py to generate planning files."

## [1.0.13] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

#### Planning Phase Completion
- Fixed planning phase not generating documents after completing all 9 questioning cycles
  - Root cause: No explicit transition instruction between Phase 2 (Document Generation) and Phase 3 (Compilation)
  - Added "Phase 2 Complete" section (lines 317-325) with explicit instruction to proceed to Phase 3 and run `compile_documents.py`
  - Claude now receives clear directive to compile documents after Document 9 verification

#### Documentation Accuracy
- Fixed "four Forge Points" to "five Forge Points" in skill description (line 4)
- Clarified document count: "7 planning document categories (14 files total)" in both description (line 4) and overview (line 13)
  - 7 categories: Crucible Thesis, Strand Maps, Forge Points, Dark Mirror, Constellation Bible, Mercy Ledger, World Forge
  - 14 files: includes 3 strand maps, 5 forge point files, and summary card

## [1.0.12] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed

#### Project Detection
- Fixed status command failing to find projects in subdirectories
  - Root cause: `find_crucible_project_with_type()` only searched upward (current dir and parents)
  - When user is in parent directory (e.g., `C:\books\test3`) with project in subdirectory (e.g., `crucible-project/`), detection failed
  - Added fallback search that checks immediate subdirectories (one level deep)
  - Skips hidden directories (starting with `.`) and handles permission errors gracefully

### Added

#### Shared Utilities
- `_check_directory_for_markers()` helper function in `cross_platform.py`
  - Extracts marker detection logic for reuse
  - Maintains priority order: `.crucible/`, `state.json`, `story-bible.json`, `planning/`

### Changed
- Updated `find_crucible_project_with_type()` docstring to document two-phase search order

## [1.0.11] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed

#### Plugin Loading
- Removed explicit `hooks` reference from plugin.json manifest
  - `hooks/hooks.json` is auto-loaded by Claude Code from the standard location
  - Explicit reference caused "Duplicate hooks file detected" error
  - Plugin now loads without errors

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-14

### Added

#### Version Tracking
- Added `VERSION` file for simple version tracking
- Added `bump_version.py` script for version management:
  - `python bump_version.py patch` - 1.0.3 -> 1.0.4
  - `python bump_version.py minor` - 1.0.3 -> 1.1.0
  - `python bump_version.py major` - 1.0.3 -> 2.0.0
- Script updates both VERSION file and plugin.json

### Improved

#### Status Report Formatting
- Redesigned `format_report_text()` with clean ASCII box layout
- Added visual progress bars `[####----]` for each phase
- Added status icons: `[x]` complete, `[>]` in progress, `[ ]` pending
- Organized sections with clear headers (PLANNING, OUTLINE, WRITING, EDITING, BACKUP)
- Cross-platform ASCII characters (works on Windows cmd/PowerShell)

### Fixed

#### Project Detection Bug
- Fixed `status_reporter.py` and `detect_project.py` failing to find planner-created projects
- Root cause: Scripts looked for `.crucible/` directory but `init_project.py` creates `state.json` at project root
- Updated `find_crucible_project()` to detect both structures:
  - `dotcrucible`: Legacy `.crucible/` directory structure
  - `rootlevel`: `state.json` at project root (planner-created)

#### Status Reporter
- Fixed document completion detection to match state.json format (string keys like `"doc1_crucible_thesis"`)
- Fixed phase detection to recognize in-progress planning (checks `current_document` field)
- Updated path resolution for planning, outline, draft, and backup directories based on structure type

#### Detect Project
- Same structure detection improvements as status_reporter.py
- Planning progress now correctly reads from `state.json` for rootlevel projects
- File-based fallback detection for outline and draft directories

### Changed
- Both detection scripts now return structure type alongside project root
- Status report includes `structure_type` field in output

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-14

### Fixed

#### Hook System Overhaul
- **Stop hook**: Changed from prompt-based to command-based
  - Prompt hooks cannot access file system, making review checks impossible
  - New `check_stop_conditions.py` script reads `draft-state.json` directly
  - Properly blocks session end when bi-chapter review is due
  - Prevents infinite loops via `stop_hook_active` check

- **SubagentStop hook**: Removed entirely
  - Prompt hooks cannot access agent output or file system
  - Was non-functional for validating review agent completeness

#### Hook Behavior
- Stop hook now correctly enforces bi-chapter reviews
- Exit code 2 with descriptive stderr message tells Claude exactly what to do
- Session cannot end until required reviews are completed

### Added

#### Scripts
- `check_stop_conditions.py` - Stop hook enforcement script
  - Reads project state from `.crucible/state/draft-state.json`
  - Checks `chapters_complete` vs `last_review_at_chapter`
  - Returns exit code 2 with action instructions when blocked
  - Returns exit code 0 when session can safely end

#### Enhanced Backup Script
- `backup_on_change.py` now includes chapter detection and review reminders:
  - `is_chapter_file()` - Detects chapter files by name patterns
  - `check_review_status()` - Checks if bi-chapter review is due
  - Outputs `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` as soft reminder
  - Claude receives context about pending reviews after chapter edits

### Changed

#### Hook Configuration
- SessionStart timeout increased from 10s to 15s for larger projects
- Stop hook now uses command type instead of prompt type
- Removed SubagentStop hook from configuration
- Updated description to reflect "review enforcement" purpose

### Technical Details
- All hooks now use command-based approach for file system access
- PostToolUse provides soft reminders via `additionalContext`
- Stop hook provides hard enforcement via exit code 2
- Hybrid approach: gentle nudges + strict gates

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-18

### Fixed

#### Hook Output Compliance
- **backup_on_change.py**: Now outputs only `hookSpecificOutput` per official Claude Code hooks specification
  - Removed non-spec fields (`success`, `action`, `backup_result`)
  - Empty `{}` output when no context needed
  - `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` only when review reminder is required

#### Model Specification
- Updated model shorthand `haiku` to full model ID `claude-haiku-4-20250514` in 4 files:
  - `commands/crucible-restore.md`
  - `commands/crucible-status.md`
  - `agents/timeline-checker.md`
  - `agents/outline-checker.md`

#### Windows Compatibility
- **safe_write_json()**: Fixed atomicity issue on Windows
  - Added fallback delete-then-move pattern when `Path.replace()` fails
  - Temp file cleanup on error

#### Error Handling
- **backup_on_change.py**: Added comprehensive OSError handling
  - Handles stdin read errors alongside JSON decode errors
  - Graceful handling of filesystem errors during project detection
  - Cleanup block now handles permission errors and file-in-use scenarios

### Changed

#### Path Encoding for Incremental Backups
- **backup_on_change.py**: Now uses base64url encoding for backup filenames
  - Replaces ambiguous underscore-based path flattening
  - Reversible encoding allows exact path reconstruction
  - Example: `draft/chapter-1.md` → `ZHJhZnQvY2hhcHRlci0xLm1k`

- **restore_project.py**: Backward-compatible path decoding
  - Tries base64url decode first (new format)
  - Falls back to underscore heuristics (legacy format)
  - Existing backups remain fully restorable

### Added

#### Shared Utilities
- **cross_platform.py**: New path encoding functions
  - `encode_path_b64(path)` - URL-safe base64 encoding
  - `decode_path_b64(encoded)` - Decode with padding restoration
  - `is_base64_encoded_path(s)` - Format detection for backward compatibility

### Technical Details
- All hook outputs now comply with official `hooks.md` specification
- Base64url encoding uses Python's `base64.urlsafe_b64encode/decode`
- Backward compatibility maintained for all existing incremental backups
- Cross-platform tested on Windows and Unix-like systems

## [1.0.10] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed

#### Model Specification
- Fixed invalid model ID in `crucible-status.md` and `crucible-restore.md`
  - Changed from non-existent `claude-haiku-4-20250514` to valid `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
  - Commands were failing with 404 API errors due to invalid model reference

#### Hook Configuration
- Temporarily disabled hooks to resolve plugin cache version mismatch
  - Hooks were referencing stale cached paths after version updates
  - Requires Claude Code restart to properly reload plugin configuration
  - Re-enable hooks after restart by restoring hooks.json content

### Changed

#### Plugin Installation Path
- Updated installed_plugins.json to point to source directory for local development
  - Allows immediate testing of plugin changes without cache rebuild

## [1.0.9] - 2025-12-19

### Added

#### Project Metadata Updates
- Added `--set` argument to `save_state.py` for updating project metadata
  - `--set title "Title"` - Update project title
  - `--set premise "Premise"` - Update project premise
  - Supports multiple `--set` flags in a single call
  - Also works for scope fields: target_length, complexity, chapters
- Example: `python save_state.py ./project --set title "New Title" --set premise "New premise"`

## [1.0.8] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed

#### Scope Answer Handling
- `save_state.py` now handles "scope" as a special document key
  - Previously failed with `KeyError: 'scope'` when skill saved scope answers via `--answer`
  - Scope answers now correctly stored in `state["scope"]` instead of `state["answers"]["scope"]`
  - Added key mapping for variations: `novel_length` -> `target_length`, `narrative_complexity` -> `complexity`
  - Automatically calculates chapter count when target_length is set

## [1.0.7] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed

#### Windows Console Encoding
- Replaced all emoji characters with ASCII equivalents in Python scripts
  - `✅` → `[OK]`
  - `❌` → `[ERROR]`
  - `✓` → `[x]` or `+`
- Windows cmd/PowerShell cannot encode Unicode emoji (charmap codec error)
- Affected 15+ scripts across planner, outliner, writer, and migration tools
- All console output now uses safe ASCII characters

### Changed
- All print statements now Windows-compatible without encoding workarounds
