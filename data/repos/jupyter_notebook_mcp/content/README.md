## 🔧 MCP Overview

### 🔧 Tools Overview

The server provides a rich set of tools for interacting with Jupyter notebooks, categorized as follows. 
For more details on each tool, their parameters, and return values, please refer to the [official Tools documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/tools).

#### JupyterLab Integration

*Available only when JupyterLab mode is enabled. It is enabled by default.*

When running in JupyterLab mode, Jupyter MCP Server integrates with [jupyter-mcp-tools](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-tools) to expose additional JupyterLab commands as MCP tools. By default, the following tools are enabled:

| Name                          | Description                                                                        |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `notebook_run-all-cells`      | Execute all cells in the current notebook sequentially                             |
| `notebook_get-selected-cell`  | Get information about the currently selected cell                                   |

<details>
<summary><strong>📚 Learn how to customize additional tools</strong></summary>

You can now customize which tools from `jupyter-mcp-tools` are available using the `allowed_jupyter_mcp_tools` configuration parameter. This allows you to enable additional notebook operations, console commands, file management tools, and more.

```bash
# Example: Enable additional tools via command-line
jupyter lab --port 4040 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --JupyterMCPServerExtensionApp.allowed_jupyter_mcp_tools="notebook_run-all-cells,notebook_get-selected-cell,notebook_append-execute,console_create"
```

For the complete list of available tools and detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the [Additional Tools documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/reference/tools-additional).

</details>

### 📝 Prompt Overview

The server also supports [prompt feature](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) of MCP, providing a easy way for user to interact with Jupyter notebooks.

| Name           | Description                                                                        |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jupyter-cite` | Cite specific cells from specified notebook (like `@` in Coding IDE or CLI)        |

For more details on each prompt, their input parameters, and return content, please refer to the [official Prompt documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/reference/prompts).

## 🏁 Getting Started

For comprehensive setup instructions—including `Streamable HTTP` transport, running as a Jupyter Server extension and advanced configuration—check out [our documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/). Or, get started quickly with `JupyterLab` and `STDIO` transport here below.

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2 jupyter-mcp-tools>=0.1.4 ipykernel
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```

> [!TIP]
> To confirm your environment is correctly configured:
> 1. Open a notebook in JupyterLab
> 2. Type some content in any cell (code or markdown)
> 3. Observe the tab indicator: you should see an "×" appear next to the notebook name, indicating unsaved changes
> 4. Wait a few seconds—the "×" should automatically change to a "●" without manually saving
> 
> This automatic saving behavior confirms that the real-time collaboration features are working properly, which is essential for MCP server integration.

### 2. Start JupyterLab

```bash
# Start JupyterLab on port 8888, allowing access from any IP and setting a token
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running notebooks through JupyterHub instead of JupyterLab as above, refer to our [JupyterHub setup guide](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech//providers/jupyterhub-streamable-http/).

### 3. Configure Your Preferred MCP Client

Next, configure your MCP client to connect to the server. We offer two primary methods—choose the one that best fits your needs:

- **📦 Using `uvx` (Recommended for Quick Start):** A lightweight and fast method using `uv`. Ideal for local development and first-time users.
- **🐳 Using `Docker` (Recommended for Production):** A containerized approach that ensures a consistent and isolated environment, perfect for production or complex setups.

<details>
<summary><b>📦 Using uvx (Quick Start)</b></summary>

First, install `uv`:

```bash
pip install uv
uv --version
# should be 0.6.14 or higher
```

See more details on [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then, configure your client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jupyter-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "JUPYTER_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "JUPYTER_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐳 Using Docker (Production)</b></summary>

**On macOS and Windows:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "JUPYTER_URL",
        "-e", "JUPYTER_TOKEN",
        "-e", "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "JUPYTER_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:8888",
        "JUPYTER_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**On Linux:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "JUPYTER_URL",
        "-e", "JUPYTER_TOKEN",
        "-e", "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT",
        "--network=host",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "JUPYTER_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "JUPYTER_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

> [!TIP]
>
> 1. **Port Configuration**: Ensure the `port` in your Jupyter URLs matches the one used in the `jupyter lab` command. For simplified config, set this in `JUPYTER_URL`.
> 1. **Server Separation**: Use `JUPYTER_URL` when both services are on the same server, or set individual variables for advanced deployments. The different URL variables exist because some deployments separate notebook storage (`DOCUMENT_URL`) from kernel execution (`RUNTIME_URL`).
> 1. **Authentication**: In most cases, document and runtime services use the same authentication token. Use `JUPYTER_TOKEN` for simplified config or set `DOCUMENT_TOKEN` and `RUNTIME_TOKEN` individually for different credentials.
> 1. **Notebook Path**: The `DOCUMENT_ID` parameter specifies the path to the notebook the MCP client default to connect. It should be relative to the directory where JupyterLab was started. If you omit `DOCUMENT_ID`, the MCP client can automatically list all available notebooks on the Jupyter server, allowing you to select one interactively via your prompts.
> 1. **Image Output**: Set `ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT` to `false` if your LLM does not support mutimodel understanding.

For detailed instructions on configuring various MCP clients—including [Claude Desktop](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/claude_desktop), [VS Code](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/vscode), [Cursor](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/cursor), [Cline](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/cline), and [Windsurf](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/windsurf) — see the [Clients documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients).

## ✅ Best Practices

- Interact with LLMs that supports multimodal input (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to fully utilize advanced multimodal understanding capabilities.
- Use a MCP client that supports returning image data and can parse it (like Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.), as some clients may not support this feature.
- Break down complex task (like the whole data science workflow) into multiple sub-tasks (like data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, etc.) and execute them step-by-step.
- Provide clearly structured prompts and rules (👉 Visit our [Prompt Templates](prompt/README.md) to get started)
- Provide as much context as possible (like already installed packages, field explanations for existing datasets, current working directory, detailed task requirements, etc.).
