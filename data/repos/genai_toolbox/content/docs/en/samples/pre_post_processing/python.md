  How to add pre- and post- processing to your Agents using Python.
---

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have set up MCP Toolbox with a basic agent as described in the [local quickstart](../../getting-started/local_quickstart.md).

This guide demonstrates how to implement these patterns in your Toolbox applications.

## Implementation

{{< tabpane persist=header >}}
{{% tab header="ADK" text=true %}}
The following example demonstrates how to use `ToolboxToolset` with ADK's pre and post processing hooks to implement pre and post processing for tool calls.

```py
{{< include "python/adk/agent.py" >}}
```
You can also add model-level (`before_model_callback`, `after_model_callback`) and agent-level (`before_agent_callback`, `after_agent_callback`) hooks to intercept messages at different stages of the execution loop. 

For more information, see the [ADK Callbacks documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/callbacks/types-of-callbacks/).
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="Langchain" text=true %}}
The following example demonstrates how to use `ToolboxClient` with LangChain's middleware to implement pre- and post- processing for tool calls.

{{< include "python/langchain/agent.py" "python" >}}

You can also add model-level (`wrap_model`) and agent-level (`before_agent`, `after_agent`) hooks to intercept messages at different stages of the execution loop. See the [LangChain Middleware documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/custom#wrap-style-hooks) for details on these additional hook types.

## Results

The output should look similar to the following.

The exact responses may vary due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and differences between orchestration frameworks.
