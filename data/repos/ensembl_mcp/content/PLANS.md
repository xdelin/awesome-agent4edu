# Ensembl MCP Server - Improvement Plans

> Plans 1-6 (caching, batch operations, response truncation, error handling, structured logging, retry logic), Plan 7 (Vitest), Plan 8 (MCP resources & prompts), Plan 9 (input validation), Plan 10 (GRCh37 support), Plan 12 (CI/CD), and Plan 13 (pagination) have been implemented. The plans below cover the next round of improvements.

---

## ~~Plan 7: Proper Test Framework (Vitest)~~ (Implemented)

> Migrated to Vitest with `@vitest/coverage-v8`. Deleted custom test runner and 12 integration test files. Created `vitest.config.ts`, migrated `input-normalizer.test.ts` and `input-validator.test.ts` to Vitest syntax, and added new unit tests for `cache.ts`, `error-handler.ts`, `response-processor.ts`, and `formatter.ts`. 152 tests across 6 files, all passing. Scripts: `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage`.

---

## ~~Plan 8: MCP Resources and Prompts~~ (Implemented)

> Implemented in `eb43ce2`. Added `src/handlers/resources.ts` (species, releases, assembly, biotypes), `src/handlers/prompts.ts` (analyze-variant, compare-orthologs, region-survey, gene-report), and wired into `index.ts` with full MCP resource/prompt protocol support.

---

## ~~Plan 9: Input Validation Before API Calls~~ (Implemented)

> Implemented with `src/utils/species-data.ts` (shared species constants), `src/utils/input-validator.ts` (8 validators + batch + tool-aware dispatcher for all 10 tools), wired into `src/handlers/tools.ts`, and `tests/input-validator.test.ts` (77 tests). Also deduplicated species data from `error-handler.ts` and `input-normalizer.ts`.

---

## ~~Plan 10: GRCh37 Support via Dedicated Server~~ (Implemented)

> Implemented with dynamic server routing based on assembly argument. Added `resolveBaseUrl()`, `getServerIdentifier()`, `checkGrch37Support()` to `src/utils/species-data.ts`. Cache keys include server prefix for isolation. Per-server release version tracking via `Map<string, string>`. All 15+ API methods and 7 batch methods thread `baseUrl` through. Assembly parameter added to 8 tool schemas. `validateAssembly()` added to input validator. Unsupported GRCh37 endpoints (homology, genetree, cafe, alignment) fail fast with clear error. 187 tests across 7 files, all passing.

---

## Plan 11: Observability and Diagnostics Tool

### Problem
No runtime visibility into server health, cache effectiveness, or API performance. When users experience slowness or errors, there's no way to diagnose without reading raw logs.

### Approach
Add an `ensembl_diagnostics` tool that exposes internal metrics and a health check.

### New Tool: `ensembl_diagnostics`

**Parameters:**
- `check_type`: `"health"` | `"cache_stats"` | `"api_stats"` | `"full"`

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "health": {
    "ensembl_api": "reachable",
    "ping_ms": 145,
    "current_release": 114,
    "server_version": "15.0"
  },
  "cache": {
    "entries": 247,
    "max_entries": 1000,
    "hit_rate": "73.2%",
    "hits": 891,
    "misses": 326,
    "evictions": 12,
    "memory_estimate_kb": 1240
  },
  "api": {
    "total_requests": 1217,
    "errors": 14,
    "retries": 8,
    "avg_response_ms": 312,
    "rate_limit_waits": 45
  }
}
```

### Files to Modify

**Modify: `src/utils/cache.ts`**
- Add `getStats(): CacheStats` method tracking hits, misses, evictions

**Modify: `src/utils/ensembl-api.ts`**
- Add request counters: `totalRequests`, `errors`, `retries`, `responseTimes[]`
- Add `getStats(): ApiStats` method
- Add `healthCheck(): Promise<HealthStatus>` -- calls `/info/ping` and `/info/data`

**Modify: `src/handlers/tools.ts`**
- Add `ensembl_diagnostics` tool definition and handler

### Size Estimate
~50 lines for stats tracking, ~40 lines for the tool definition/handler.

---

## ~~Plan 12: CI/CD Pipeline~~ (Implemented)

> Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with three parallel jobs: typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`), unit tests (`vitest run --coverage` with coverage artifact upload), and Docker build verification. Triggers on push to main and pull requests.

---

## ~~Plan 13: Pagination for Large Result Sets~~ (Implemented)

> Added `page` and `page_size` parameters to 5 tools (`ensembl_feature_overlap`, `ensembl_regulatory`, `ensembl_meta`, `ensembl_compara`, `ensembl_variation`). Extended `ProcessOptions` and `ProcessedResponse.metadata` with pagination fields (`page`, `page_size`, `total_pages`, `has_next`). Updated `truncateArray` to support offset-based slicing. `page_size` supersedes `max_results` when both provided. Out-of-range pages return empty data with correct metadata. Backward-compatible — omitting pagination params produces identical output. Added `validatePagination` to input validator, wired into all 5 tool validators. 220 tests across 7 files, all passing.

---

## Plan 14: Streaming for Large Responses

### Problem
Large FASTA sequences and 200-item batch results get truncated at a hard limit. MCP supports streaming content, which would let clients receive data incrementally instead of losing it.

### Approach
Use MCP's streaming capabilities for tools that can return large payloads.

### Candidates for Streaming
- `ensembl_sequence` -- FASTA output for long sequences or batch requests
- `ensembl_compara` -- large gene tree results
- Batch operations -- 200-item results

### Files to Modify

**Modify: `src/handlers/tools.ts`**
- For qualifying responses, use MCP's `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` or chunked text content
- Fall back to truncation for clients that don't support streaming

### Size Estimate
~80 lines. Depends on MCP SDK streaming support maturity.
