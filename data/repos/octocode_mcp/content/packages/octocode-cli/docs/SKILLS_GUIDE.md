# Skills Guide

> Comprehensive guide to Octocode Skills - pre-built AI assistant behaviors for Claude Code and compatible AI coding assistants.

## Overview

**Skills** are markdown-based instruction sets that teach AI assistants how to perform specific tasks. They transform generic AI assistants into specialized experts for code research, implementation, PR review, and more.

### What Are Skills?

Skills are `.md` files that define:
- **Agent Identity**: Role, objectives, and principles
- **Tooling**: Which MCP tools to use and when
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step execution flows
- **Decision Frameworks**: How to handle uncertainty and edge cases
- **Output Formats**: Structured responses and deliverables

### Why Use Skills?

| Without Skills | With Skills |
|----------------|-------------|
| Generic responses | Domain-expert behavior |
| Inconsistent workflows | Structured execution flows |
| Manual tool selection | Automatic tool orchestration |
| Ad-hoc output formats | Consistent deliverables |
| No validation gates | Built-in checkpoints |

## Installation

### Option 1: CLI Command (Recommended)

```bash
# Install via npx
npx octocode skills install

# Or if installed globally
octocode skills install
```

This copies all official skills to `~/.claude/skills/` for global availability.

### Option 2: Interactive Menu

```bash
npx octocode
# Select "🎯 Skills Manager"
# Choose "🐙 Octocode Official"
# Select skills to install
```

### Option 3: Manual Copy

```bash
# Global (all projects)
cp -r skills/octocode-* ~/.claude/skills/

# Project-specific
cp -r skills/octocode-* .claude/skills/
```

### Installation Paths

| Platform | Default Path |
|----------|--------------|
| macOS/Linux | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude\skills\` |

Custom paths can be set via the CLI:
```bash
octocode skills
# Select "📁 Change default skills path"
```

## Skill Structure

### Standard Layout

```
{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md              # Main reference (<500 lines)
└── references/           # Supporting documentation (optional)
    ├── tool-reference.md
    └── workflow-patterns.md
```

### SKILL.md Format

Skills use YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Use when [specific triggers]...
---

# Skill Title

## Flow Overview
`PHASE1` → `PHASE2` → `PHASE3`

## 1. Agent Identity

## Creating Custom Skills

### Guidelines

1. **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** - Use `references/` for detailed documentation
2. **Description = When to Use** - Don't describe workflow, describe triggers
3. **Test with pressure scenarios** before deploying
4. **Follow the standard structure** - Consistent format helps AI parse correctly

### Template

```yaml
---
name: my-custom-skill
description: Use when [specific scenario]...
---

# My Custom Skill

## Flow Overview
`PHASE1` → `PHASE2` → `OUTPUT`

## 1. Agent Identity
<agent_identity>
Role: **Custom Agent**. Expert in [domain].
**Objective**: [What it does].
**Principles**: [Core behaviors].
</agent_identity>

## 2. Scope & Tooling
<tools>
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `localSearchCode` | Find patterns |
| `localGetFileContent` | Read implementations |
</tools>

## 3. Execution Flow
<key_principles>
1. **Step 1**: Description
2. **Step 2**: Description
3. **Output**: Deliverable format
</key_principles>
```

### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use XML tags for sections | Use plain markdown headers only |
| Provide tool transition matrices | List tools without context |
| Include confidence levels | Assume all findings are certain |
| Add user checkpoints | Execute without confirmation |
| Cite file paths precisely | Give vague references |

---

## Shared Principles

All official skills follow these core principles:

1. **Local-First**: Prefer local tools over shell commands
2. **Research Before Action**: Always gather evidence first
3. **User Checkpoints**: Ask before major actions
4. **TaskCreate/TaskUpdate**: Track progress with tasks
5. **Validation**: Green build required
6. **No Time Estimates**: Never provide timing
7. **Evidence Citing**: Include file paths and code references

---

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Loading

1. Verify installation path:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

2. Check SKILL.md frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: Required description
   ---
   ```

3. Ensure Claude Code is configured to read skills

### Skill Not Triggering

- Check the `description` field matches your use case
- Try explicitly mentioning the skill name
- Verify the skill is in the correct directory

### Marketplace Fetch Errors

- Check network connectivity
- GitHub API rate limits may apply
- Try again later or use manual installation
