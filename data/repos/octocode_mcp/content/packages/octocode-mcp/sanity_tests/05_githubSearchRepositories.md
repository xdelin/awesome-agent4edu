# Sanity Test: `githubSearchRepositories`

---

## Tool Overview

Searches GitHub repositories by keywords, topics, stars, creation date, and owner. Returns rich metadata including stars, forks, topics, visibility, and timestamps.

## Enhanced Testing Requirements

**ALL test cases must validate:**
1. **Queries Structure** - Every query includes `mainResearchGoal`, `researchGoal`, and `reasoning` (wrap bulk in `{ "queries": [{ ... }] }`)
2. **Pagination/Limits** - Test `limit`, `page` parameters for result management
3. **Hints Validation** - **GOLDEN**: Check response hints for user guidance and next steps

### Hints Validation Checklist
- [ ] Response includes helpful hints for repo discovery
- [ ] Hints suggest repo exploration, code search, or PR analysis next steps
- [ ] Pagination hints when results are truncated
- [ ] Status-specific hints present (hasResults, empty, error)

---
