# ELA-Tutor-Agent-System-Prompting-Experiment
This repository contains the files associated with experiment to use system prompting to transform an AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini) into a specialized English Language Arts (ELA) tutor that can conduct a conversation about a given text with middle school students (U.S. Grades 6-8). This specialized tutoring assistant is called "Reid."

## Context
A central goal in secondary English Language Arts (ELA) education is to help students reach a benchmark proficiency level in reading comprehension, critical literary analysis, and written communication skills. As of 2024, however, the percentage of eighth-grade students who performed at or above the national proficiency benchmark in the U.S. was just 30%. This indicates an urgent need to improve ELA education, which is the goal of many dedicated teachers. 

Yet, the emergence of AI poses a significant challenge to these teachers. It has the potential to wreak further havoc on student progress when used to write papers, summarize readings, or answer test questions. Teachers will need to adapt their methods in order to mitigate the harmful, counterproductive use of this new technology, and many might be wondering how they can funnel student interest in AI toward more beneficial applications—applications which create highly individualized and effective learning experiences to supplement the help of a teacher.

The biggest issue here is that AI tools are being used to generate content rather than stimulate student thinking. A 2023 report from the U.S. Department of Education, however, offered *Intelligent Tutoring Systems* as exemplifying a potentially beneficial use of AI in the classroom. These systems are designed to help students work through problems step-by-step, rather than provide an answer to an assignment prompt. One potential use of AI for the classroom, then, is to design AI agents that can be used as discussion partners which shape the way students engage with a literary text. When designed to use the same pedagogical methods employed by teachers in classroom discussions, an AI agent designed for this purpose could potentially guide students through a thinking process that helps them express their own thoughts more confidently and engage more critically with the texts encountered in school. While the social benefits of engaging in human discussions are undoubtedly irreplaceable, AI agents could empower some low-engagement students (students who do not often speak up, who are unable to keep up with the pace of the group conversation etc.) to have conversations adapted to their level with a devoted, one-on-one partner while teachers simultaneously perform necessary one-on-one or small group tasks with other students.

However, this suggested use of AI in ELA classrooms has not been empirically tested, as far as I can tell. Thus, for this project I am designing an applied experiment to put this use to the test. I am attempting to build an AI agent via prompt engineering which can be used as a discussion partner in middle school ELA classrooms. It should be responsive to the individual student’s level of comprehension and engagement; it should encourage critical, thoughtful responses; and it should flat-out refuse to give easy answers to students if asked. Furthermore, it should utilize evidence-based approaches to classroom discussion from the domain of educational pedagogy. I will engage with the agent in repeat trials as various simulated student personas in order to test its effectiveness. Then, I will evaluate its performance.

You can test out Reid for yourself by viewing this React application I designed with Claude. You will need to sign up or log in with Claude in order to use the app. Never share personal information in your conversations with the tutor.
