## Step 1: Identify Scenario

First, identify the user's purpose. Classify into one of the three scenarios:

### New Introduction Phase
**Indicators:**
- "We're just starting with accessibility"
- "Where should we begin?"
- Little to no prior initiatives

**Characteristics:** Prioritize baseline establishment, foundational training, seeding design system

### Acceleration Phase
**Indicators:**
- "We want to systematize existing efforts"
- "We want to be more efficient"
- Have some track record

**Characteristics:** Prioritize governance strengthening, QA gates, toolchain automation

### External Audit Response Phase
**Indicators:**
- "We have an audit coming" "There's litigation risk"
- "We need to comply by [date]"
- Urgent response to regulations or external requirements

**Characteristics:** Prioritize rapid triage, legal alignment, communication plan

### Ambiguous Cases
Ask the user:
```
I'll help develop an accessibility improvement strategy. Which situation is closest to yours?

1. **New Introduction** - Just starting to work on accessibility
2. **Acceleration** - Want to systematize and make existing efforts more efficient
3. **External Audit Response** - Need urgent response to regulations or audits
```

## Step 2: Gather Information

Once the scenario is identified, collect information in the following order. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask questions efficiently.

### Stage 0: Reference Documents (Check first)

If documentation about prior initiatives exists, reading it first enables more accurate planning.

**Example documents to read:**
- Accessibility test results / conformance reports
- History of prior initiatives / retrospective documents
- Existing a11y guidelines / policies
- Tech stack or organizational structure descriptions

**Example question:**
```
Do you have any reference documents for planning?
(e.g., test results, initiative history, guidelines, etc.)

Please provide the file path and I'll review the contents.
For multiple files, separate paths with commas.
If none, reply "none".
```

If file paths are provided, use the `Read` tool to load the content and keep it as context. The information will be used for maturity assessment and roadmap creation.

### Stage 1: Required Items (Always confirm first)

These items are essential for strategy development. Combine multiple questions efficiently:

| Category | Question Item | What to Confirm |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Business | Target users | B2B/B2C, who are decision makers |
| Business | Target market | US, Europe, Asia, Global, specific regions only |
| Technical | Design system | Existence, coverage |
| Technical | Legacy code | Approximate amount (high/medium/low) |
| Technical | UI quality | Current quality level (good/average/needs improvement) |
| Organization | Team structure | Team composition, dedicated personnel |
| Organization | Prior initiatives | Track record, content |

**Example questions:**
```
Let me ask a few questions for strategy development:

1. **Target users and market**
   - Is this B2B or B2C? For B2B, who are the decision makers?
   - What is your target market? (US, Europe, Asia, Global, etc.)

2. **Technical situation**
   - Do you have a design system? If so, what's its coverage?
   - How much legacy code do you have? (high/medium/low)
   - How would you rate your current UI quality?

3. **Organizational situation**
   - Please describe your team structure (design, frontend, QA, etc.)
   - Please share any prior accessibility improvement initiatives
```

### Stage 2: Context-Dependent Items (Confirm based on scenario)

Additional items to confirm based on scenario:

| Scenario | Additional Items |
|----------|------------------|
| New Introduction | Budget expectations, executive understanding, reference cases |
| Acceleration | Current bottlenecks, tooling environment, CI/CD status |
| External Audit Response | Deadline, target scope, legal/compliance structure |

### Stage 3: Optional Items (If user has additional information)

Not required but improves strategy accuracy:

- Competitor situation
- Procurement requirements (public sector, etc.)
- Vendor involvement status
- Past audit results or user feedback

## Step 3: Maturity Assessment

Based on collected information, assess the organization's accessibility maturity.

### Maturity Levels

| Level | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| L1 | Ad hoc | Depends on individual goodwill, no systematic initiatives |
| L2 | Repeatable | Some reproducible practices exist, documentation lacking |
| L3 | Managed | Processes defined, organizational ownership exists |
| L4 | Scalable | Automation and measurement established, continuous improvement cycle running |

### Assessment Axes

Evaluate on these 5 axes:

1. **Governance**: Policies, responsible parties, budget existence
2. **Design System**: A11y-enabled component readiness
3. **Engineering**: Coding standards, review processes
4. **QA/Verification**: Test automation, manual verification structure
5. **Training**: Education programs, skill assessment

### Output Format

```markdown
## Maturity Assessment

**Current Level**: L2 Repeatable

### Assessment Rationale

| Axis | Rating | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Governance | L1 | Point of contact exists but no policy defined |
| Design System | L2 | Some components have a11y support |
| Engineering | L2 | Code review includes a11y but ad-hoc |
| QA/Verification | L1 | Manual checks only, no automated tests |
| Training | L1 | No systematic education program |

### Strengths
- Design system foundation exists
- Some engineers have a11y knowledge

### Gap Summary
- No lifecycle-wide gates established
- Cross-organizational ownership unclear
- Measurement mechanisms not established

### Target Level
**12-month target**: L3 Managed
```

## Step 4: Strategy Draft Generation

Based on maturity assessment, generate draft deliverables.

**Important**: See `references/output-templates.md` for detailed output templates.

### 4.1 Roadmap

Create a phased improvement plan:

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Immediate | 0-1 months | Quick wins, urgent fixes |
| Near-term | 2-3 months | Foundation building, process setup |
| Mid-term | 4-6 months | Automation, scaling |
| Long-term | 7-12 months | Culture building, continuous improvement |

**Scope Recommendation**: For organizations in **New Introduction phase** with **limited resources** or **large/legacy codebases**, strongly recommend limiting the initial scope:

- **Pilot scope selection criteria**:
  - High-traffic features used by many users
  - Critical features like login, checkout
  - Prioritize new development over legacy code (easier to improve, easier to create success stories)
- **Rationale**: Showing results each quarter is critical for sustaining initiatives. Smaller scope enables hitting milestones on schedule rather than extending timelines.
- **Pattern**: "Succeed with one first" → "Scale horizontally" is more sustainable than attempting organization-wide change from day one.

When recommending scope limitation, explain to the user:
```
Given your situation (new to accessibility + [limited resources / large codebase / legacy code]),
I recommend starting with a limited scope:

Recommended pilot scope: [specific recommendation based on their context]
- Start with high-traffic features used by many users, or critical features like login
- Prioritizing new development over legacy makes it easier to show results

Benefits of this approach:
- Show concrete results each quarter (important for continued investment)
- Build internal expertise before scaling
- Create a success story that makes horizontal expansion easier

Once the pilot succeeds, you can expand scope in subsequent cycles.
```

### 4.2 KPI/Metrics Design

**Leading Indicators**:
- Percentage of components with a11y specs defined
- Review coverage
- Training completion rate

**Lagging Indicators**:
- Audit finding counts (by severity)
- Rework rate
- A11y-related support tickets

### 4.3 Stakeholder Persuasion Materials

Organize around business impact:

- **Risk**: Regulatory violations, litigation risk, market access restrictions
- **Opportunity**: Market expansion, brand value, user satisfaction improvement
- **Cost**: Future cost of not addressing vs. cost of addressing now

## Scenario-Specific Guidance

See `references/scenario-playbooks.md` for detailed guidance for each scenario.

## Output Format

Final output follows "5. Complete Strategy Report Structure" in `references/output-templates.md`.

Key sections:
1. Executive Summary
2. Current Assessment (Maturity Assessment, Key Challenges)
3. Strategic Roadmap (4 Phases)
4. KPIs/Metrics (Leading, Lagging)
5. Stakeholder Talking Points
6. Next Steps

## Step 5: Review and Adjustment

After presenting the strategy draft, engage with the user to refine the strategy.

### 5.1 Collect Feedback

After presenting the draft, ask for feedback on these points:

```
Please review the strategy draft. I'd like your feedback on:

1. **Are any initiatives already done or in progress?**
   - We'll remove or adjust them in the roadmap

2. **Are any initiatives difficult to implement?**
   - Resource, budget, or organizational constraints?
   - We'll consider alternatives

3. **Would you like to change priorities?**
   - Reorder phases or adjust timelines

4. **Would you like to add any initiatives?**
   - Organization-specific efforts or requirements

5. **Any other concerns?**
```

### 5.2 Adjustment Patterns

| Feedback | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "We already do this" | Remove from roadmap or mark as "ongoing" |
| "This is difficult" | Understand why, propose alternatives or defer to later phase |
| "We want this first" | Move to earlier phase, verify dependencies |
| "Add X" | Add to appropriate phase, consider KPIs |
| "Timeline too short/long" | Adjust based on organizational capacity |

### 5.3 Iteration

Continue feedback cycles as needed. Keep adjusting until user confirms the strategy is acceptable.

## Step 6: File Export

Once strategy is finalized, export as a Markdown file.

### 6.1 Confirm Output Path

Ask user for output location:

```
I'll save the strategy as a Markdown file.
Please specify the path (e.g., ./docs/a11y-strategy.md)
```

Default suggestion: `./a11y-strategy-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### 6.2 Write File

Use `Write` tool to save the final strategy.

Include at the end of the file:

```markdown
---
*This strategy was created on [date].*
*Review periodically (quarterly recommended) and update based on progress.*
```

### 6.3 Suggest Next Actions

After export, suggest:

- How to share the strategy with stakeholders
- When to start the first action items
- Setting up regular review schedule

## Notes

- **Be specific**: Not abstract recommendations but concrete actions
- **Be realistic**: Create executable plans considering organizational resources and constraints
- **Be flexible**: Adjust timelines and priorities based on user's situation
- **Business perspective**: Always tie explanations to business impact
- **Be interactive**: After draft generation, dialogue with user to refine the strategy
