## Claude Instructions

```xml
<progress_rules>
When working with this progress log:

1. READ recent entries (last 3-5) at session start for context
2. ADD a new dated entry at the end of each significant session
3. BE SPECIFIC about what was completed (file names, function names)
4. RECORD decisions with rationale — future you will thank you
5. LIST issues even if unresolved — they're important context
6. PLAN next steps to enable smooth session resumption

Update format:
## YYYY-MM-DD (Day of Week)

### Focus
### Completed
### Decisions
### Issues
### Next Steps
</progress_rules>
