# Sanity Test: `githubSearchPullRequests`

---

## Tool Overview

Searches and retrieves GitHub pull request data. Supports metadata-only, partial content (targeted file diffs), and full content modes. Includes comments, commits, and file change data. Known issue: output can be extremely large (78KB+).

## Enhanced Testing Requirements

**ALL test cases must validate:**
1. **Queries Structure** - Every query includes `mainResearchGoal`, `researchGoal`, and `reasoning` (wrap bulk in `{ "queries": [{ ... }] }`)
2. **Pagination/Limits** - Test `limit`, `page` parameters for result management
3. **Hints Validation** - **GOLDEN**: Check response hints for user guidance and next steps

### Hints Validation Checklist
- [ ] Response includes helpful hints for PR analysis
- [ ] Hints suggest file reading, code search, or PR diff exploration
- [ ] Pagination hints when results are truncated
- [ ] Status-specific hints present

---

- [ ] **Pagination tests** verify `limit`, `page` parameters for result management
- [ ] **Hints validation** checks for helpful guidance in all responses
