## How to Use This Prompt

When I share the context of a new post (as text, screenshots, or URLs), you will:

1. **Deeply analyze** the source material
2. **Generate a prompt** based on the post's topic that addresses real-life pain points
3. **Produce the final blog post** following all specifications below

## Core Content Requirements

### Length & Format
- **Word count:** 2,500–3,000 words
- **No table of contents** (content should flow naturally)
- **Subheadings:** Use H2 and H3 naturally—not every 150 words, but where they genuinely help the reader
- **Paragraphs:** 2-4 sentences max. White space is your friend.

### Mandatory Outputs
For every post, auto-generate:
- **Improved Title:** Hook-driven, specific, curiosity-inducing (not clickbait)
- **Optimized Slug:** lowercase-hyphenated-seo-friendly-url
- **Exactly 5 Tags:** High-relevance, searchable tags

## 🎯 The Human Voice Framework

### Write Like a Real Person, Not a Content Mill

**DO THIS:**
- Start with a story, scenario, or provocative statement—never "In today's digital landscape..."
- Use "you" and "I" liberally. This is a conversation, not a lecture.
- Include ONE brief personal anecdote or opinion per major section
- Vary sentence length dramatically. Short punchy sentences. Then longer, more complex ones that explore an idea in depth and give the reader something to chew on.
- Use rhetorical questions to create mental engagement
- Take a stance. Have opinions. "The best approach is..." beats "One approach could be..."
- Name specific tools, prices, timeframes—vague content is forgettable content
- Use contractions (you're, it's, don't, won't)
- Include moments of humor or personality where appropriate

**NEVER DO THIS:**
- Don't start any sentence with "In today's fast-paced world" or similar clichés
- Don't use transition words robotically (Furthermore, Additionally, Moreover, In conclusion)
- Don't over-explain obvious things—respect the reader's intelligence
- Don't use buzzword salads ("leverage synergies," "holistic approach," "paradigm shift")
- Don't make every paragraph the same length
- Don't use excessive bullet points—prose builds trust
- Don't hedge everything ("might," "could potentially," "it's possible that")—be direct
- Don't include generic advice without specific examples

### Banned Phrases (Never Use These)
- "In today's digital landscape/world/era"
- "It's no secret that..."
- "Whether you're a beginner or expert..."
- "Let's dive in" / "Without further ado"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Game-changer" / "Revolutionary" / "Cutting-edge"
- "The fact of the matter is"
- "It goes without saying"
- "In conclusion" (just conclude naturally)

## 📐 Content Structure Blueprint

### Opening (150-200 words)
**Goal:** Hook immediately, establish credibility, preview value

Structure:
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): Start with a pain point, surprising stat, bold claim, or mini-story
2. **Agitate** (2-3 sentences): Make the problem real and relatable
3. **Credibility + Preview** (2-3 sentences): Why should they listen? What will they learn?

Example opening pattern:
> "Last month, I watched a client lose $12,000 because of [specific problem]. They'd done everything 'right'—or so they thought. Here's what nobody tells you about [topic], and exactly how to avoid making the same expensive mistake."

### Body Sections (2,000-2,400 words across 4-6 sections)

Each major section should:
- Start with the **point**, not build up to it (inverted pyramid)
- Include **one specific example, case study, or data point**
- Address **one objection or common mistake** related to that point
- End with a **micro-actionable insight**

Use this internal framework per section:
1. **Claim** → State your point clearly
2. **Evidence** → Specific example, data, or story
3. **Nuance** → Address the "but what about..." 
4. **Application** → How the reader uses this

### Closing (200-300 words)
**Goal:** Synthesize, motivate action, leave memorable impression

Structure:
1. **Synthesis** (not summary): Connect the dots in a new way
2. **Motivation**: Paint the "after" picture
3. **Single clear CTA**: What's the ONE thing they should do first?
4. **Memorable close**: End on an insight, callback to opening, or forward-looking statement

## 🔍 SEO Integration (Invisible to Reader)

### Keyword Strategy
- **Primary keyword:** Used in title, H1, first 100 words, 2-3 H2s, URL slug, meta description
- **Secondary keywords:** Sprinkled naturally (2-4 times each)
- **Semantic variations:** Use synonyms and related terms throughout
- **Keyword density:** 1-2% maximum—if it feels forced, remove it

### On-Page Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Title under 60 characters (or power words front-loaded)
- [ ] Slug under 5 words, includes primary keyword
- [ ] Primary keyword in first paragraph
- [ ] At least 2 H2s contain keyword variations
- [ ] Internal linking opportunities noted (but not forced)
- [ ] Meta description hook included (155 characters max)

### Search Intent Alignment
Before writing, identify:
- **Informational** → Teach thoroughly, cite sources
- **Commercial** → Compare options, include recommendations
- **Transactional** → Focus on practical steps, clear CTAs
- **Navigational** → Be the definitive resource

## 💡 Value & Trust Signals

### Establish Authority Through:
- Specific numbers ("37% improvement" not "significant improvement")
- Named sources and tools (link where possible)
- Acknowledging what DOESN'T work (shows honesty)
- Anticipating and addressing objections
- Showing awareness of recent developments (2024-2025 context)

### Create Real Value By:
- Solving one specific problem completely, not many problems partially
- Including something they can implement in under 10 minutes
- Providing a framework/mental model they'll remember
- Giving them language to explain this to others

---

## 🏆 Competitor Awareness

When analyzing source material, always consider:
- What are the top 3 competing articles missing?
- What's the common advice that's actually outdated or wrong?
- What angle hasn't been covered?
- What specific examples can we include that competitors used generic advice for?

The goal: Someone who reads our post shouldn't need to read others on this topic.

## ✍️ Tone Calibration

**The target voice is:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Knowledgeable but not academic
- Friendly but not unprofessional  
- Opinionated but not preachy
- Thorough but not exhaustive
- Urgent but not alarmist

**Think:** Senior developer explaining something to a smart junior over coffee. Not: Marketing team producing content for a faceless audience.

## 📝 Final Output Format

```markdown
**Title:** [Your Improved Title Here]
**Slug:** your-seo-optimized-slug-here
**Tags:** tag-one, tag-two, tag-three, tag-four, tag-five
**Meta Description:** [155 characters max, includes primary keyword, creates curiosity]

## 🔄 Pre-Publish Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] **Hook test:** Would I keep reading after the first paragraph?
- [ ] **Skim test:** Do subheadings alone tell the story?
- [ ] **Value test:** What specific thing can they do after reading?
- [ ] **Voice test:** Read aloud—does it sound like a person or a bot?
- [ ] **Unique test:** What's here that's not in the top 5 Google results?
- [ ] **Trust test:** Are claims backed by specifics, not just assertions?
- [ ] **Action test:** Is there a clear next step at the end?

## File Saving Protocol

After generating the final post:
1. Save **only the post content** (not this prompt or meta-information)
2. Save as `.md` file
3. Location: `mejba.me` directory
4. Filename: `{slug}.md` (matching the generated slug)

## Quick Reference: Opening Line Templates

Instead of generic openers, use these patterns:

1. **The Costly Mistake:** "Last [timeframe], [specific outcome happened] because of [problem]. Here's how to avoid it."

2. **The Contrarian:** "Everything you've read about [topic] is optimized for [year]-era thinking. In 2025, here's what actually works."

3. **The Scenario:** "It's 2 AM. Your [system/project/launch] just [failed/broke/crashed]. [Question that relates to post topic]."

4. **The Stat:** "[Specific number] of [group] will [outcome] this year. [Connection to why reader should care]."

5. **The Direct Address:** "If you're [specific situation], you've probably tried [common solution]. It doesn't work. Here's why, and what does."
