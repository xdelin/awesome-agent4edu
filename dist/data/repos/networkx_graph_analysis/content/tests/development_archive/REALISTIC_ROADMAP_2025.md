## 🏆 CONCLUSION

This roadmap is deliberately conservative and realistic. It acknowledges that building production-ready software is hard, especially for academic users who have high reliability expectations.

The key insight from the brutal reality check is that the technical foundation is solid, but the operational and business challenges are significant. Success depends on:

1. **Focusing on Real Users**: Academic researchers with actual needs
2. **Incremental Progress**: Building production readiness step by step
3. **Measuring Success**: Real metrics, not synthetic benchmarks
4. **Sustainable Growth**: Building a business that can support long-term development

The opportunity is real, but it requires honest assessment, proper planning, and sustained effort. This roadmap provides a realistic path from the current research-grade tool to a production-ready platform that researchers will actually use and pay for.
