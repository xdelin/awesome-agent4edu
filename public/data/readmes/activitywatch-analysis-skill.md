# ActivityWatch Analysis Skill

A Claude Code skill for weekly productivity analysis using [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/) data. Calculates focus scores, detects "death loops" (repetitive app switching), and generates actionable insights.

## Features

- **Smart Auto-Categorization**: Classifies activities into productive/neutral/distracting
- **AI Agent Detection**: Recognizes Claude Code, Codex, Aider, GitHub Copilot as productive workflows
- **Dual Scoring**: Productivity score (what you worked on) + Focus score (attention quality)
- **Deep Browser Analysis**: Site-level breakdown (Netflix, GitHub, ChatGPT) with productivity ratios
- **Death Loop Detection**: Identifies repetitive app switching patterns with fix suggestions
- **Actionable Insights**: Specific recommendations with blocking guides
- **Customizable Categories**: JSON config to tune for your workflow
- **Timezone Support**: Correctly handles ActivityWatch UTC timestamps

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/) installed and running
- Optional: `aw-client` for direct API access (`pip install aw-client`)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct API Fetch (Recommended)

If you have `aw-client` installed (`pip install aw-client`), you can fetch data directly from ActivityWatch:

```bash
# Analyze today's productivity
python scripts/analyze_aw.py --fetch --from today --report --timezone America/Los_Angeles

# Analyze yesterday
python scripts/analyze_aw.py --fetch --from yesterday --report

# Analyze the past week
python scripts/analyze_aw.py --fetch --from week --report

# Analyze specific date range
python scripts/analyze_aw.py --fetch --from 2025-12-20 --to 2025-12-26 --report

# Analyze last 7 days
python scripts/analyze_aw.py --fetch --from 7d --report
```

**Supported date formats:**
- Keywords: `today`, `yesterday`, `week`
- Relative: `7d` (7 days ago), `2w` (2 weeks ago)
- Absolute: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-12-26`)

### Option 2: CSV Export (Fallback)

If you don't have `aw-client` or prefer manual export:

1. Open ActivityWatch (`http://localhost:5600`) → Raw Data → Export → CSV
2. Run analysis:

```bash
# Human-readable report (uses system timezone)
python scripts/analyze_aw.py export.csv --report

# With explicit timezone
python scripts/analyze_aw.py export.csv --timezone America/Los_Angeles --report

# With custom categories
python scripts/analyze_aw.py export.csv --config scripts/category_config.json --report

# JSON output for automation
python scripts/analyze_aw.py export.csv > summary.json
```

### Recommended Workflow

Before trusting a weekly report, spot-check with a single day's data:

1. **Spot-check first**: Verify timezone, idle time, and categories match your experience
2. **Fix issues**: Adjust timezone or config if needed
3. **Run full analysis**: Once validated, trust the weekly report

## Understanding Your Scores

### Combined Score (0-100)

| Range | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 80-100 | Excellent - Deep work patterns, minimal distractions |
| 60-79 | Good - Solid productivity with room to improve |
| 40-59 | Moderate - Attention fragmented, review death loops |
| 0-39 | Needs work - High distraction, consider app blockers |

### Productivity vs Focus

- **Productivity Score**: Measures *what* you spent time on (deep work vs. entertainment)
- **Focus Score**: Measures *how* you worked (sustained attention vs. constant switching)

You can have high productivity but low focus (doing good work but constantly interrupted) or vice versa.

## Death Loops

Death loops are repetitive A↔B app switches that fragment your attention.

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 🤖 ai_assisted | AI coding agent active (Claude Code, Codex) | Productive workflow |
| 🟢 productive | Normal workflow (IDE ↔ Terminal) | Consider split screen |
| 🟡 mixed | Could go either way | Batch these activities |
| 🔴 distracting | Attention leak | Block during focus hours |

See `references/blocking_guides.md` for step-by-step setup of macOS Focus Mode, Cold Turkey, and other blocking tools.

## Customizing Categories

Edit `scripts/category_config.json` to match your workflow:

```json
{
  "my_product": {
    "weight": 0.8,
    "description": "My SaaS product work",
    "apps": [],
    "titles": ["MyApp", "myapp.com"]
  }
}
```

**Weight scale:**
- `1.0` = Deep work (Terminal, IDE)
- `0.7-0.9` = Productive (AI tools, writing)
- `0.5` = Mixed (meetings)
- `0.3` = Shallow (email, chat)
- `0.0` = Neutral (system utilities)
- `-0.2 to -0.5` = Distracting (entertainment, social)

## Weekly Review Ritual

Every Sunday (15 min):

1. Export week's data from ActivityWatch (CSV)
2. Run: `python scripts/analyze_aw.py export.csv --report`
3. Review the "One Change" recommendation
4. Implement one intervention
5. Track score improvement next week

## Integration with Claude Code

As a Claude Code skill, you can ask:

```
"Analyze my ActivityWatch export from this week"
"Show me my death loops and how to fix them"
"What are my peak productive hours?"
```
