# Linear MCP Server

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/linear-mcp-server.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-mcp-server) [![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/linear-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/linear-mcp-server)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This MCP Server is now deprecated and is no longer being maintained. I recommend you use the official Linear remote MCP server here: https://linear.app/changelog/2025-05-01-mcp (https://mcp.linear.app/sse)

A [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) server for the [Linear API](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api).

This server provides integration with Linear's issue tracking system through MCP, allowing LLMs to interact with Linear issues.

Some example prompts you can use with Claude Desktop to interact with Linear:

1. "Show me all my high-**priority** issues" → execute the `search_issues` tool and/or `linear-user:///{userId}/assigned` to find issues assigned to you with priority 1

2. "Based on what I've told you about this bug already, make a bug report for the authentication system" → use `create_issue` to create a new high-priority issue with appropriate details and status tracking

3. "Find all in progress frontend tasks" → use `search_issues` to locate frontend-related issues with in progress task

4. "Give me a summary of recent updates on the issues for mobile app development" → use `search_issues` to identify the relevant issue(s), then `linear-issue:///{issueId}` fetch the issue details and show recent activity and comments

5. "What's the current workload for the mobile team?" → combine `linear-team:///{teamId}/issues` and `search_issues` to analyze issue distribution and priorities across the mobile team
