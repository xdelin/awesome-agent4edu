## Data Transparency

This skill sends your search query, an agent identifier, and any selected URLs to `api.rhdxm.com`. The skill does not access local files, environment variables, or credentials on its own, but anything you include in the query or agent_id will be transmitted. Avoid sending sensitive or proprietary content.
