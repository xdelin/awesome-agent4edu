## 🚀 How to Use Skills

### Method 1: Claude.ai Web Interface

1. **Enable Skills** in Settings → Capabilities → Skills toggle
2. **Paste the skill content** into a new conversation
3. **Reference the skill** in your prompts
4. **Let Claude use it** automatically for relevant tasks

### Method 2: Claude Desktop App

1. **Open Claude Desktop**
2. **Go to Settings** → **Capabilities** → **Skills**
3. **Enable Skills** toggle
4. **Use naturally** in conversations

Example:
```
I need to analyze customer feedback and create an analysis document.
Can you use the feedback analysis skill to help with this?
```

### Method 3: Claude Code (CLI)

Skills work in Claude Code with the `/skills` command:

```bash
# View available skills
/skills list

# Use a specific skill
/skills load feedback-analysis
```

### Method 4: API Integration

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

# Include skill instructions in system prompt
system_prompt = """
You are a document analyst with the following skill available:
[Skill Content Here]
Use this skill when analyzing documents.
"""

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-5-20251101",  # Updated Jan 2026
    max_tokens=2048,
    system=system_prompt,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Analyze this customer feedback using the skill"
        }
    ]
)

print(response.content[0].text)
```

## 🆕 Wrapper Pattern for Token Efficiency (Jan 2026)

> **New in January 2026:** The wrapper pattern dramatically reduces token consumption while maintaining full skill functionality.

### The Problem

Loading full skill content into every conversation wastes tokens. A complex skill might be 500+ lines but only 50 lines are needed for most invocations.

### The Solution: Thin Wrappers

Create a **thin SKILL.md** (50-100 lines) that:
1. Provides essential context and triggers
2. References separate implementation files
3. Loads details on-demand via progressive disclosure

### Wrapper Structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Thin wrapper (≤100 lines)
├── implementation/
│   ├── phase-1.md        # Detailed procedures
│   ├── phase-2.md        # Advanced patterns
│   └── troubleshooting.md
└── examples/
    └── real-world.md
```

### Benefits

| Metric | Traditional | Wrapper Pattern |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Initial Load | 500+ lines | 50-100 lines |
| Token Cost | High | 70-80% reduction |
| Context Space | Consumed | Preserved |
| Flexibility | Low | High |

For complete implementation details, see the [Skills Guide - Wrapper Pattern](../docs/skills-guide.md#wrapper-pattern-architecture).
