### Analyze symptoms:

```python
from scripts.triage import analyze_symptoms
import os

# Set environment variables
os.environ["SKILL_BILLING_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

# Analyze patient symptoms
result = analyze_symptoms(
    symptoms="胸痛，呼吸困难，持续30分钟",

# Check result
if result["success"]:
    print("分诊等级:", result["triage"]["level"])
    print("紧急程度:", result["triage"]["urgency"])
