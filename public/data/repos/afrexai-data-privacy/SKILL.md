## Phase 1: Privacy Program Assessment

### Quick Health Check
Run this 3-minute triage first:

| Area | Question | 🟢 Good | 🟡 Risk | 🔴 Critical |
|------|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| Data inventory | Do you know what personal data you collect? | Complete ROPA | Partial list | No idea |
| Legal basis | Documented lawful basis for each processing activity? | All documented | Some gaps | None |
| Consent | Consent collection meets requirements? | Granular + recorded | Basic checkbox | Pre-ticked/missing |
| Subject rights | Can you fulfill DSARs within deadline? | Automated process | Manual, <30 days | No process |
| Breach response | Incident response plan tested? | Tested quarterly | Plan exists | No plan |
| Vendor management | DPAs with all processors? | All signed | Some gaps | None |
| Retention | Data retention schedule enforced? | Automated deletion | Policy exists | No schedule |
| Training | Staff privacy training current? | Annual + role-based | Ad-hoc | None |

### Privacy Maturity Model (1-5 per dimension)

```yaml
privacy_maturity:
  governance: _/5        # Leadership, DPO, budget, reporting
  data_inventory: _/5    # ROPA completeness, data flows mapped
  legal_compliance: _/5  # Lawful bases, consent, notices
  individual_rights: _/5 # DSAR process, response times
  security: _/5          # Technical + organizational measures
  vendor_management: _/5 # DPAs, processor oversight
  incident_response: _/5 # Breach detection, notification
  culture: _/5           # Training, awareness, privacy-by-design
  total: _/40
  tier: _  # <15 Ad-hoc | 15-24 Developing | 25-32 Defined | 33-38 Managed | 39-40 Optimized
```

### Program Assessment Brief

## Phase 2: Regulatory Landscape & Applicability

### Regulation Applicability Matrix

| Regulation | Jurisdiction | Triggers | Key Deadlines | Max Penalty |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **GDPR** | EU/EEA + monitoring/offering to EU | ANY processing of EU resident data | 72h breach notify | €20M or 4% global revenue |
| **UK GDPR** | UK | Same as GDPR for UK residents | 72h breach notify | £17.5M or 4% revenue |
| **CCPA/CPRA** | California | >$25M rev OR >100K consumers OR >50% rev from selling data | 45 days DSAR | $7,500/violation |
| **LGPD** | Brazil | Processing of data in Brazil or of Brazil residents | 72h breach notify (advisory) | 2% revenue, max R$50M |
| **PIPEDA** | Canada | Commercial activity processing personal info | ASAP breach notify | C$100K/violation |
| **POPIA** | South Africa | Processing of SA resident data | ASAP notify | R10M or imprisonment |
| **APPI** | Japan | Business operators handling personal info | Prompt notify | ¥100M (corporate) |
| **PDPA** | Singapore/Thailand | Processing in SG/TH or affecting residents | 3 days (SG) | S$1M |

### Applicability Decision Tree
1. **Where are your users/customers?** → Maps to jurisdictions
2. **What data do you collect?** → Determines sensitivity level
3. **How much data?** → Triggers thresholds (CCPA)
4. **Do you sell/share data?** → Additional obligations
5. **Cross-border transfers?** → Transfer mechanism requirements

### Regulation-Specific Quick Start
**If GDPR applies first:**
1. Appoint DPO (if required: public authority, large-scale monitoring, special categories)
2. Build ROPA (Article 30)
3. Establish lawful bases for all processing
4. Update privacy notices
5. Implement DSAR process
6. Sign DPAs with all processors
7. Assess cross-border transfers (SCCs/adequacy)

**If CCPA/CPRA applies first:**
1. Update privacy policy (right to know, delete, opt-out)
2. Add "Do Not Sell/Share" link
3. Implement consumer request process
4. Map data sales/sharing
5. Review service provider contracts
6. Assess sensitive personal info processing

## Phase 3: Data Inventory & Mapping (ROPA)

### Record of Processing Activities (ROPA) Template

```yaml
processing_activity:
  id: "PA-001"
  name: "[e.g., Customer Account Management]"
  description: "[What this processing involves]"
  
  # GDPR Article 30 required fields
  controller: "[Legal entity name]"
  dpo_contact: "[DPO email]"
  purpose: "[Specific purpose — not generic]"
  lawful_basis: "[consent|contract|legal_obligation|vital_interest|public_task|legitimate_interest]"
  legitimate_interest_assessment: "[If LI, document balancing test]"
  
  # Data details
  data_subjects: ["customers", "employees"]
  data_categories:
    - category: "Identity"
      fields: ["name", "email", "phone"]
      sensitivity: "standard"
    - category: "Financial"  
      fields: ["payment card", "bank account"]
      sensitivity: "high"
    - category: "Special category"
      fields: ["health data"]
      sensitivity: "special"
      additional_condition: "[explicit consent / employment law / ...]"
  
  # Data flow

  storage_location: "[System, provider, region]"
  recipients:
    internal: ["Marketing team", "Support team"]
    processors: ["Stripe (payments)", "AWS (hosting)"]
    third_parties: ["Analytics partner"]
    cross_border: 
      - destination: "US"
        mechanism: "SCCs + supplementary measures"
  
  # Lifecycle
  retention_period: "[e.g., 3 years after account closure]"
  retention_justification: "[Legal requirement / business need]"
  deletion_method: "[automated/manual]"
  
  # Security
  security_measures: ["encryption at rest", "encryption in transit", "access controls", "audit logging"]
  dpia_required: [yes/no]
  dpia_reference: "[DPIA-001 if applicable]"
  
  # Metadata
  owner: "[Business process owner]"
  last_reviewed: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  next_review: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  status: "active"
```

### Data Mapping Process
1. **Interview business units** — 30-min sessions per department
2. **Review systems** — CRM, HRIS, marketing tools, analytics
3. **Trace data flows** — Collection → Processing → Storage → Sharing → Deletion
4. **Classify sensitivity** — Standard / High / Special Category
5. **Identify gaps** — Undocumented processing, missing lawful bases
6. **Validate with IT** — Technical data flow matches business understanding

### Data Classification Framework

| Level | Description | Examples | Controls Required |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Public** | Freely available | Marketing materials | Basic |
| **Internal** | Business use only | Employee directory | Access controls |
| **Confidential** | Restricted access | Customer PII, financial | Encryption + access controls |
| **Sensitive** | Special protection | Health, biometric, criminal | Encryption + DPA + DPIA + minimal access |
| **Restricted** | Maximum protection | Payment cards (PCI), SSN | All above + dedicated controls |

## Phase 4: Privacy Notices & Consent Management

### Privacy Notice Checklist (GDPR Article 13/14)

Must include:
- [ ] Controller identity and contact details
- [ ] DPO contact details (if applicable)
- [ ] Purposes of processing (specific, not vague)
- [ ] Lawful basis for each purpose
- [ ] Legitimate interests pursued (if LI basis)
- [ ] Recipients or categories of recipients
- [ ] Cross-border transfer details + safeguards
- [ ] Retention periods (specific, not "as long as necessary")

### Consent Management Framework

```yaml
consent_record:
  id: "CON-001"
  data_subject_id: "[hashed identifier]"
  purpose: "[Specific purpose]"
  consent_text: "[Exact wording shown]"
  collection_method: "[web form / app / verbal / paper]"
  timestamp: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
  ip_address: "[if web]"
  version: "[privacy policy version at time of consent]"
  granular: true  # Separate consent per purpose
  freely_given: true  # Not bundled with service
  withdrawable: true  # Easy mechanism exists

## Phase 5: Individual Rights (DSAR Management)

### Rights by Regulation

| Right | GDPR | CCPA/CPRA | LGPD | PIPEDA |
|-------|------|-----------|------|--------|
| Access/Know | ✅ 30 days | ✅ 45 days | ✅ 15 days | ✅ 30 days |
| Rectification | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Erasure/Deletion | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Limited |
| Restrict Processing | ✅ | ✅ (limit use) | ✅ | Limited |
| Portability | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Object | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Opt-out of sale/share | N/A | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Non-discrimination | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Automated decisions | ✅ | ✅ (profiling) | ✅ | Limited |
| Appeal | ❌ | ✅ (CPRA) | ❌ | ❌ |

### DSAR Process Workflow

```
1. RECEIVE → Log request, assign ID, acknowledge within 3 business days
2. VERIFY → Confirm identity (2-factor for sensitive data)
   - Email verification + government ID for high-risk
   - Account login for authenticated users
   - DON'T collect more data than needed to verify
3. SCOPE → Determine what's being requested
   - Which right(s)?
   - Which data/processing activities?
   - Any exemptions apply?
4. SEARCH → Query all systems for subject's data
   - Production databases
   - Backups (note: different rules may apply)
   - Third-party processors
   - Paper records
5. REVIEW → Apply exemptions if applicable
   - Third-party data (redact others' personal data)
   - Trade secrets / IP
   - Legal privilege
   - Ongoing investigations
6. RESPOND → Within deadline, in accessible format
   - Access: Provide data in structured, machine-readable format
   - Deletion: Confirm deletion, notify processors
   - Portability: CSV or JSON, common format
7. CLOSE → Document response, update DSAR log
```

## Phase 6: Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

### DPIA Trigger Checklist
A DPIA is **required** when processing is likely to result in high risk. Check if ANY apply:

- [ ] Systematic and extensive profiling with significant effects
- [ ] Large-scale processing of special category data
- [ ] Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas (CCTV)
- [ ] New technology deployment (AI/ML, biometrics, IoT)
- [ ] Automated decision-making with legal/significant effects
- [ ] Large-scale processing (>100K data subjects in 12 months)
- [ ] Matching or combining datasets from different sources
- [ ] Processing of vulnerable individuals (children, employees, patients)
- [ ] Processing that prevents individuals from exercising rights
- [ ] Cross-border data transfer outside adequacy decisions

**Rule of thumb:** If 2+ criteria from the above list apply → DPIA mandatory.

### DPIA Template

```yaml
dpia:
  id: "DPIA-001"
  project: "[Project/system name]"
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD"

## Phase 7: Vendor & Processor Management

### Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Essentials

Every processor must have a DPA. Required terms:

| Clause | Requirement | Red Flag if Missing |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Subject matter & duration | What processing, how long | ⚠️ Scope unclear |
| Nature & purpose | Why processor handles data | ⚠️ Purpose creep risk |
| Data types & subjects | What data, whose data | ⚠️ Unlimited scope |
| Controller obligations | What controller must do | ⚠️ Ambiguous responsibilities |
| Processor obligations | Process only on instructions | 🔴 No instruction limitation |
| Confidentiality | Staff confidentiality obligations | ⚠️ Weak protection |
| Security measures | Appropriate technical/organizational measures | 🔴 No security commitment |
| Sub-processors | Prior authorization + same obligations | 🔴 Unrestricted sub-processing |
| International transfers | Transfer mechanisms (SCCs) | 🔴 Unlawful transfer risk |
| Data subject rights | Assist with DSAR fulfillment | ⚠️ Can't fulfill rights |
| Breach notification | Notify without undue delay (24-72h) | 🔴 No breach notification |
| Audit rights | Controller can audit/inspect | ⚠️ No oversight |
| Return/deletion | Return or delete data on termination | 🔴 Data stuck with vendor |
| Liability & indemnification | Proportionate liability | ⚠️ Check carefully |

### Vendor Privacy Assessment Scorecard (0-100)

```yaml
vendor_assessment:
  vendor: "[Name]"
  service: "[What they do]"
  data_types: ["email", "name", "usage data"]
  assessment_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  
  scores:

    breach_history: _/15        # Past incidents, response quality
    sub_processor_mgmt: _/10   # Transparency, controls
    cross_border: _/10          # Transfer mechanisms, data residency
    reputation: _/10            # Market standing, regulatory history
    total: _/100
    
  decision: ""  # ≥80 Approve | 60-79 Approve with conditions | <60 Reject
  conditions: []
  review_frequency: "annual"  # annual | semi-annual | quarterly (for high-risk)
```

### Cross-Border Transfer Mechanisms
1. **Adequacy decisions** — EU Commission-approved countries (check current list)
2. **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** — EU 2021 module selection:
   - Module 1: Controller → Controller
   - Module 2: Controller → Processor (most common)
   - Module 3: Processor → Sub-processor
   - Module 4: Processor → Controller
3. **Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)** — Intra-group transfers
4. **Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA)** — Required with SCCs for non-adequate countries
5. **Supplementary measures** — Encryption, pseudonymization, access controls

### Transfer Impact Assessment Quick Framework
```
1. Identify transfer — What data, where, which mechanism
2. Assess destination law — Government access, surveillance, judicial redress
3. Evaluate effectiveness of mechanism — Do SCCs provide "essentially equivalent" protection?
4. Supplementary measures needed? — Technical (encryption, pseudonymization), contractual, organizational
5. Document decision — If no effective measure possible, suspend transfer
```

## Phase 8: Data Breach Management

### Breach Response Playbook

**Phase 1: Detection & Containment (0-4 hours)**
1. Confirm breach — Is personal data actually compromised?
2. Contain immediately — Isolate affected systems, revoke access, change credentials
3. Activate incident team — DPO, IT Security, Legal, Comms, Business Owner
4. Start timeline log — Every action timestamped

**Phase 2: Assessment (4-24 hours)**
```yaml
breach_assessment:
  id: "BR-YYYY-NNN"
  detection_date: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
  detection_method: "[monitoring alert / employee report / third party / data subject]"
  
  scope:
    data_subjects_affected: "[count or estimate]"
    data_categories: ["names", "emails", "financial"]
    special_categories: [yes/no]
    records_affected: "[count]"
    
  nature:
    type: "[confidentiality / integrity / availability]"
    cause: "[cyber attack / human error / system failure / theft / unauthorized access]"
    vector: "[phishing / vulnerability / misconfiguration / insider / lost device]"
    
  risk_to_individuals:
    likelihood_of_harm: "[low/medium/high]"
    severity_of_harm: "[low/medium/high]"
    risk_level: "[low/medium/high]"  # Determines notification obligations
    potential_harms: ["identity theft", "financial loss", "discrimination", "reputational"]
```

**Phase 3: Notification (24-72 hours)**

| Risk Level | Supervisory Authority | Data Subjects | Timeline |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| Low | Consider documenting only | Not required | — |
| Medium | Yes — 72h (GDPR) | Case-by-case | 72h authority |
| High | Yes — 72h | Yes — without undue delay | 72h authority + ASAP subjects |

**Authority Notification Must Include:**
- Nature of breach
- Categories and approximate number of data subjects
- Categories and approximate number of records
- DPO contact details
- Likely consequences
- Measures taken/proposed to address

**Data Subject Notification Must Include:**
- Nature of breach in clear, plain language
- DPO contact details
- Likely consequences
- Measures taken and recommended steps

**Phase 4: Recovery & Review (72h+)**
1. Root cause analysis
2. Remediation plan with deadlines
3. Update security measures
4. Post-incident review meeting
5. Update breach register
6. Lessons learned → Update policies

### Breach Register

```yaml
breach_register_entry:
  id: "BR-2025-001"
  date_detected: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  date_contained: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  date_resolved: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  nature: "[confidentiality breach]"
  cause: "[phishing attack]"
  data_subjects_affected: 0
  records_affected: 0
  data_categories: []
  risk_level: "high"
  authority_notified: [yes/no]
  authority_notification_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  subjects_notified: [yes/no]
  subjects_notification_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  root_cause: "[description]"
  remediation: "[actions taken]"
  lessons_learned: "[what changed]"
```

## Phase 9: Privacy by Design & Default

### 7 Foundational Principles (Cavoukian)
1. **Proactive not reactive** — Prevent, don't remediate
2. **Privacy as default** — Automatic protection, no action required
3. **Privacy embedded** — Built into design, not bolted on
4. **Full functionality** — Positive-sum, not zero-sum (privacy AND functionality)
5. **End-to-end security** — Full lifecycle protection
6. **Visibility/transparency** — Open, verifiable
7. **Respect for users** — User-centric, empowering

### Privacy Engineering Checklist (Per Feature/Product)

## Phase 11: Advanced Privacy Topics

### Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

| Technology | Use Case | Privacy Benefit | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Anonymization** | Analytics, research | Irreversible de-identification | Medium |
| **Pseudonymization** | Processing with reduced risk | Reversible, reduces exposure | Low |
| **Differential privacy** | Statistical queries, ML | Mathematical privacy guarantee | High |
| **Homomorphic encryption** | Computing on encrypted data | Data never decrypted | Very High |
| **Secure multi-party computation** | Joint analysis without sharing | No party sees other's data | High |
| **Federated learning** | ML without centralizing data | Data stays on device | High |
| **Synthetic data** | Testing, development | No real personal data | Medium |
| **Data masking** | Non-production environments | Realistic but not real | Low |
| **Tokenization** | Payment processing | Sensitive data replaced | Low |
| **Zero-knowledge proofs** | Age verification, credentials | Prove without revealing | High |

### Anonymization vs Pseudonymization Decision
```
Is the data TRULY anonymous? Apply this test:
1. Can you single out an individual? → NOT anonymous
2. Can you link records to an individual? → NOT anonymous  
3. Can you infer information about an individual? → NOT anonymous

All three must be NO, considering:
- All means reasonably likely to be used
- Cost and time of re-identification
- Available technology
- Future developments

If truly anonymous → Outside privacy regulation scope
If pseudonymous → Still personal data, but lower risk
```

### Children's Data (Extra Protections)

| Jurisdiction | Age of Consent | Parental Consent Required |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| GDPR (default) | 16 | Under 16 |
| UK | 13 | Under 13 |
| US (COPPA) | 13 | Under 13 |
| France | 15 | Under 15 |
| Germany | 16 | Under 16 |
| Spain | 14 | Under 14 |
| Brazil (LGPD) | 18 | Under 18 (best interest) |

**Rules for children's data:**
1. Age verification mechanism required
2. Simplified privacy notice in child-friendly language
3. No profiling or behavioral advertising
4. Parental consent verifiable (not just checkbox)
5. Delete data when no longer necessary
6. DPIA mandatory for large-scale children's data

### Employee Privacy

| Processing | Lawful Basis | Key Rules |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Payroll & benefits | Contract / Legal obligation | Minimum necessary |
| Performance monitoring | Legitimate interest (with LIA) | Transparent, proportionate |
| Email/internet monitoring | Legitimate interest (with LIA) | Privacy notice, not excessive |
| CCTV | Legitimate interest | DPIA, signage, retention limits |
| Background checks | Consent / Legal obligation | Proportionate to role |
| Health data | Employment law exception | Strict access controls |
| Biometric (access) | Consent / Legitimate interest + DPIA | Alternative must exist |

## Phase 12: Program Quality & Continuous Improvement

### 100-Point Privacy Program Scoring Rubric

| Dimension | Weight | Score 0-10 | Weighted |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Governance & accountability | 15% | _/10 | _ |
| Data inventory (ROPA) | 15% | _/10 | _ |
| Legal compliance (bases, notices) | 15% | _/10 | _ |
| Individual rights (DSAR) | 12% | _/10 | _ |
| Security & breach management | 12% | _/10 | _ |
| Vendor management (DPAs) | 10% | _/10 | _ |
| Privacy by design | 10% | _/10 | _ |
| Culture & training | 11% | _/10 | _ |
| **Total** | **100%** | | **_/100** |

**Grading:**
- 90-100: Leading — Exceeds requirements, proactive
- 75-89: Strong — Compliant with room for optimization
- 60-74: Adequate — Meets minimum, gaps exist
- 40-59: Developing — Significant gaps, prioritize remediation
- <40: Critical — Major compliance risk, immediate action

### Quarterly Review Template

```yaml
quarterly_review:
  period: "YYYY-QN"
  
  regulatory_changes:
    - regulation: "[e.g., GDPR guidance update]"
      impact: "[what changes for us]"
      action_needed: "[update policy / process change / none]"
      deadline: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  
  program_achievements: []
  open_issues:
    - issue: "[description]"
      severity: "[high/medium/low]"
      owner: "[who]"
      target_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  
  metrics_summary:
    dsar_on_time_pct: 0
    breaches: 0
    training_completion: 0
    vendor_compliance: 0
    health_score: 0
  
  next_quarter_priorities: []
  budget_status: "[on track / needs adjustment]"
```

### Common Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Fix |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Generic privacy notices ("we may collect data") | Specific purposes, specific data, specific recipients |
| 2 | Consent as default lawful basis | Use contract/legitimate interest where appropriate — consent has withdrawal risk |
| 3 | No retention schedule | Define and automate — "we keep everything forever" is non-compliant |
| 4 | DPAs missing for processors | Audit all vendors processing personal data, sign DPAs |
| 5 | DSAR process untested | Run mock DSARs quarterly to verify you can fulfill within deadline |
| 6 | Treating pseudonymization as anonymization | Pseudonymized data is still personal data under GDPR |
| 7 | Ignoring cross-border transfers | Map all data flows, implement transfer mechanisms |
| 8 | One-time compliance effort | Privacy is ongoing — review quarterly, update continuously |
| 9 | No breach response plan | Document and test before you need it |
| 10 | Privacy team works in isolation | Embed privacy in product, engineering, marketing, HR |

### Edge Cases

**Startup with no privacy program:**
Start with: Privacy notice → ROPA (top 5 processing activities) → DSAR process → DPA template. Takes ~2 weeks for basics.

**Post-acquisition integration:**
Run assessment on acquired entity within 30 days. Gap analysis against your standards. DPA review for all their vendors. Data mapping of combined entity. Timeline: 90 days for integration.

**Regulatory investigation:**
Cooperate fully. Engage privacy counsel immediately. Preserve all evidence. Document everything. Don't delete anything.

**Multi-jurisdiction company:**
Build to highest standard (GDPR), then adapt down. Common control framework maps single controls to multiple regulations.

**AI/ML heavy organization:**
DPIA for every ML model processing personal data. Transparency about automated decisions. Bias audits. Model cards. Right to human review.

## Natural Language Commands

Respond to these intuitively:
1. "Assess our privacy program" → Run Phase 1 maturity assessment
2. "Which regulations apply to us?" → Phase 2 applicability analysis
3. "Map our data processing" → Phase 3 ROPA creation
4. "Review our privacy notice" → Phase 4 checklist audit
5. "Help with a DSAR" → Phase 5 workflow guidance
6. "Do we need a DPIA?" → Phase 6 trigger checklist
7. "Assess this vendor" → Phase 7 vendor scorecard
8. "We had a data breach" → Phase 8 response playbook (URGENT)
9. "Privacy review for this feature" → Phase 9 engineering checklist
10. "Quarterly privacy review" → Phase 10+12 dashboard + review
11. "Should we anonymize or pseudonymize?" → Phase 11 decision guide
