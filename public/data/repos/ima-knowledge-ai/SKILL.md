  Critical knowledge base for AI content creation — READ THIS FIRST before any image/video/music 
  generation task. Provides expert guidance on workflow design, model selection, parameter optimization, 
  visual consistency, character design, and production best practices. Essential reading before using 
  ima-image-ai, ima-video-ai, ima-voice-ai, ima-all-ai, or any other media generation skills 
  (ai-image-generation, ai-video-gen, suno-music, etc.). Use for: planning workflows, choosing models, 
  optimizing prompts and parameters, maintaining character/style consistency, multi-shot production, 
  avoiding common mistakes. Transforms beginner attempts into professional-grade results. This is a 
  knowledge skill — it provides strategic guidance, not API calls.

# IMA Knowledge AI

> **Purpose**: This skill provides strategic knowledge to help agents make better decisions when using IMA Studio's content creation APIs. It does NOT make API calls directly — instead, it guides you to use `ima-voice-ai`, `ima-image-ai`, `ima-video-ai` more effectively.

## When to Use This Skill

**Read this skill BEFORE calling any ima-*-ai skill** if you need guidance on:

1. **Workflow Design** — How to break down complex user requests into atomic tasks
2. **Model Selection** — Which model to choose based on task requirements
3. **Parameter Optimization** — How to set parameters for quality, cost, or speed

**Example scenarios**:
- User: "帮我做个宣传视频" → Read `workflow-design.md` first
- User: "用最好的模型生成" → Read `model-selection.md` to pick the right one
- User: "生成16:9的图片" → Read `parameter-guide.md` for aspect ratio support

## Knowledge Structure

**All knowledge files live under the `references/` directory.** When reading from other skills, use paths like `ima-knowledge-ai/references/workflow-design.md` or `~/.openclaw/skills/ima-knowledge-ai/references/<filename>.md`.

This skill contains **12 knowledge modules** (8 standalone + 4 modular directories):

### Core Knowledge (1-8)

[ima-knowledge-ai] Query relevant knowledge
  ↓
Make informed decision
  ↓
[ima-*-ai] Execute API call with optimized parameters
  ↓
Success!
```

**Example flow**:
```
User: "帮我生成一张16:9的产品海报，要高质量"

Step 1: Read ima-knowledge-ai → parameter-guide.md
        → Learn: SeeDream 4.5 supports 16:9, Nano Banana Pro native support
        
Step 2: Read ima-knowledge-ai → model-selection.md
        → Choose: Nano Banana Pro 4K (best quality, 18pts)
        
Step 3: Call ima-image-ai with:
        --model-id gemini-3-pro-image
        --extra-params '{"aspect_ratio": "16:9", "size": "4K"}'
        
Step 4: Success! 🎉
```

## Important Notes

1. **This skill does NOT replace ima-*-ai skills**  
   Use it as a consultant before executing tasks

2. **Knowledge is based on production IMA Studio API (2026-02-27)**  
   Models and parameters may change; always verify with `list-models`

3. **Cost transparency**  
   All recommendations include credit cost for user decision-making

4. **No scripts in this skill**  
   Pure knowledge — implementation is handled by other ima-*-ai skills
