## Creating Your Own Lessons

### Step 1: Start Simple
Begin with basic plotting and calculations:

- "Calculate the kinetic energy of a 2kg object moving at 10 m/s"
- "Convert 100 miles per hour to meters per second"

### Step 2: Add Complexity
Combine multiple concepts:
- "Plot the wave function for a particle in a box and calculate the probability of finding it in the left half"
- "Show how the period of a pendulum depends on its length"

### Step 3: Create Interactive Demos
Use parameter sweeps and animations:
- "Animate how the electric field changes as I move a charge around"
- "Show how the blackbody spectrum changes with temperature"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 🚨 "Server won't start"
- Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Check if port is already in use: `pnpm dev` will show error messages
- Try restarting your computer if dependencies seem corrupted

### 🚨 "AI assistant doesn't recognize the tools"
- Verify the MCP server is running (you should see "Server ready for connections")
- Check that your AI client is configured to use MCP
- Try asking: "What tools are available?" to see if the connection works

### 🚨 "Plot doesn't show up"
- Check that Python scientific libraries are installed: `pip install matplotlib numpy scipy`
- Look for error messages in the server console
- Try a simple plot first: "Plot y = x from -1 to 1"

### 🚨 "Students can't access the tools"
- Make sure the server is running on a network-accessible computer
- Check firewall settings if using shared lab computers
- Consider using web-based interfaces for easier access
