All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## v0.7.2 - 2025-12-03

### Fixed

- **Dependency Compatibility**: Fixed installation error with rmcp-0.10.0

## [v0.7.1] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed

- Generate default schema for tools with no params. Resolves #122

## [v0.7.0] - 2025-09-19

### New Features

- **Document Reading Tool**: Added new `read` tool for reading document content
  with universal document identification support. The tool supports reading from
  buffer IDs, project-relative paths, and absolute file paths with optional
  line range specification (start/end parameters). This enables comprehensive
  document content access for analysis and processing workflows
- **LSP Call Hierarchy Support**: Added comprehensive call hierarchy support
  with three new LSP tools: `lsp_call_hierarchy_prepare`,
  `lsp_call_hierarchy_incoming_calls`, and `lsp_call_hierarchy_outgoing_calls`.
  These tools provide full call hierarchy navigation capabilities including
  preparing call hierarchy items at specific positions, finding incoming
  callers, and discovering outgoing calls with complete range information
- **LSP Type Hierarchy Support**: Added comprehensive type hierarchy support
  with three new LSP tools: `lsp_type_hierarchy_prepare`,
  `lsp_type_hierarchy_supertypes`, and `lsp_type_hierarchy_subtypes`.
  These tools provide full type hierarchy navigation capabilities including
  preparing type hierarchy items at specific positions, finding supertypes
  (parent types/interfaces), and discovering subtypes (implementations/derived types)
  with complete range and symbol information
- **Dynamic Connection Status in Server Info**: Enhanced server information to
  include real-time connection status display showing current connection mode
  and active connections with their IDs and targets. This provides better
  visibility into the server state for debugging and operational awareness

### Improved

- **Enhanced Tool Documentation**: Added external documentation for `buffer_diagnostics`
  tool with separate markdown file containing detailed parameter descriptions.
  Updated tool registration to use external documentation instead of inline
  descriptions for better maintainability and richer documentation
- **Enhanced Cursor Position Tool**: Extended cursor position tool to include
  buffer ID and window ID in addition to existing buffer name and coordinates,
  providing more comprehensive cursor context information
- **Reduce Token Usage and Improve Compatibility**:
  Removed redundant MCP server instructions and enriched tool descriptions
  to ensure compatibility with agents that do not parse server-level instructions.
- **Position Parameter Refactoring**: Refactored LSP tool parameter structures
  to use a unified `Position` type with `#[serde(flatten)]` attribute instead of
  separate `line` and `character` fields. This improves API consistency and
  reduces boilerplate code across all LSP tools that accept position parameters
- **Position Type Documentation**: Simplified Position struct documentation by
  removing redundant encoding details that are better handled at the protocol level
- **Connection Setup Refactoring**: Extracted common client setup logic into
  `setup_new_client` method to reduce code duplication between `connect_path`
  and `connect_tcp` methods
- **Tool Filtering Enhancement**: Improved tool filtering to automatically
  filter out connection-aware tools when no active connections exist,
  providing cleaner tool listings for users

## [v0.6.0] - 2025-08-30

### Fixed

- **FormattingOptions Deserialization**: Fixed `FormattingOptions` to support both
  string and struct deserialization formats for better compatibility with various
  MCP clients
- **Dynamic Tools Plugin Dependency** (#62): Added plugin availability check before
  Lua tool discovery to prevent errors when nvim-mcp plugin is not installed.
  Server now gracefully handles missing plugin and continues with static tools only
- **Lua Tool Discovery for Empty Registries**: Fixed handling of cases where no
  Lua tools are registered by returning null/empty map instead of failing. Added
  fallback values for missing tool descriptions and input schemas to prevent
  errors during tool registration
- **Test Environment Isolation**: Added `-i NONE` flag to Neovim test instances
  to disable shada file loading, ensuring consistent test behavior across different
  environments and preventing interference from user's vim history and settings

### New Features

- **Navigation Tool**: Added `navigate` tool to navigate to a specific position
  in the current buffer or open a file at a specific position with universal
  document identification support
- **Cursor Position Tool**: Added `cursor_position` tool to get current cursor
  position with buffer name and zero-based row/col coordinates
- **LSP Readiness Tool**: Added `wait_for_lsp_ready` tool for ensuring LSP client
  readiness before performing operations, improving reliability of LSP workflows

### Improved

- **Configurable LSP Timeout**: Added `NeovimClientConfig` with configurable LSP
  timeout settings (default: 3000ms) for better control over LSP operation timing
- **Enhanced Notification Tracking**: Comprehensive notification tracking system
  for robust LSP synchronization and event handling
- **Autocmd Setup**: Unified autocmd setup replacing diagnostics-specific
  implementation with more comprehensive event handling
- **Test Performance**: Optimized integration tests with better timing and
  one-time binary compilation for improved CI performance
- **Code Coverage**: Use **grcov** for LLVM-based code coverage
  with HTML, Cobertura, and Markdown report generation
- **CI Coverage Integration**: Added codecov.io integration with automated
  coverage reporting in GitHub Actions
- **Lua Plugin Type Annotations**: Added comprehensive type annotations for
  `SetupOptions`, `CustomTool`, and `JSONSchema` classes to improve IDE support
  and documentation clarity

## [v0.5.0] - 2025-08-20

### Fixed

- **LSP Workspace Symbols**: Fixed `lsp_workspace_symbols` return type to use
  `Option<DocumentSymbolResult>` instead of `WorkspaceSymbolResult` for
  consistency with other LSP tools
- **Diagnostic Schema**: Relaxed Diagnostic JSON schema to accept code as
  number or string for better compatibility

### New Features

- **Automatic Connection**: Added automatic connection feature with CLI support
  for seamless integration with current project Neovim instances
- **Project-Scoped Auto-Discovery**: Automatically find and connect to Neovim
  instances associated with the current project directory
- **Flexible Connection Modes**: Support for manual, automatic, and specific
  target connection modes via CLI
- **HTTP Server Transport**: Added HTTP server mode for web-based integrations
  with streamable HTTP transport support
- **Multi-Transport Support**: Server now supports both stdio (default) and
  HTTP server transport modes for different integration scenarios

### Experimental Features (Unstable)

⚠️ **Warning**: The following features are experimental and unstable. They may
change significantly or be removed in future versions without prior notice.
Use at your own risk.

  target (TCP address/socket path)
  - `manual`: Traditional workflow using get_targets and connect tools
  - `auto`: Automatically connect to all project-associated Neovim instances
  - Specific target: Direct connection to TCP address or socket path
