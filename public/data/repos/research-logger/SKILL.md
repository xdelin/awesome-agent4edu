# Research Logger 📝🔬

Search + auto-save pipeline. Every research query is logged to SQLite with Langfuse tracing.

## When to Use

- Research that you want to save and recall later
- Building a knowledge base from repeated searches
- Reviewing past research on a topic
- Creating an audit trail of research decisions

## Usage

```bash
# Search and auto-log
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/research_logger.py log quick "what is RAG"
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/research_logger.py log pro "compare vector databases" --topic "databases"

# Search past research
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/research_logger.py search "vector databases"

# View recent entries
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/research_logger.py recent --limit 5
```
