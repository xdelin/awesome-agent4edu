### Example

```markdown
## Stakeholder Talking Points

### Executive Summary
Current accessibility maturity is L2 (Repeatable), urgently needing transition to systematic approach. Target L3 (Managed) in 12 months to reduce regulatory risk and enable market expansion.

### Why Act Now

#### Risks (If Not Addressed)
- **Legal Risk**: EU European Accessibility Act (EAA) effective June 2025 may impact EU market service delivery
- **Market Risk**: Public sector and enterprise procurement increasingly requires a11y compliance. Non-compliance means bid disqualification
- **Reputation Risk**: Competitors starting to use a11y compliance in marketing

#### Opportunities (If Addressed)
- **Market Expansion**: 15% of world population, about 1 billion people have some disability. Growing domestic market with aging population
- **Competitive Advantage**: Meeting procurement requirements opens public sector and enterprise sales channels
- **User Value**: Aging target market makes support for users with declining vision, hearing, and motor function a competitive differentiator

### Return on Investment

| Item | If Addressed Now | If Addressed Later |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Fix cost | Design stage: 1x | Post-release: 10-30x |
| Market opportunity | Complete before EAA | Lost sales during urgent post-deadline response |
| Legal risk | Planned reduction | Increased litigation risk, higher response costs |

### Recommended Actions
1. **This month**: Approve a11y policy and formally appoint responsible person
2. **Within 3 months**: Complete a11y check integration into dev process
3. **Within 6 months**: Achieve Level AA compliance for key features
