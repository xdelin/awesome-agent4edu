## Overview

### Execution Flow

**CRITICAL: Complete phases 1-5 in order. Self-Check and Constraints apply throughout.**

```
SEQUENTIAL PHASES:
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 2.5 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5
(INIT)   (CONTEXT)  (FAST-PATH)  (PLAN)   (RESEARCH) (OUTPUT)
                        │                      ↑
                        └── simple lookup ─────┘

CROSS-CUTTING (apply during all phases):
├── Self-Check Protocol - Run after EVERY action
└── Global Constraints - ALWAYS apply
```

### Phase Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|----|---------|
| Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Server returns "ok" |
| Phase 2 | Phase 2.5 | Context loaded, prompt selected |
| Phase 2.5 | Phase 3 | Not fast-path (needs planning) |
| Phase 2.5 | Phase 4 | Fast-path (simple lookup) |
| Phase 3 | Phase 4 | User approves plan |
| Phase 4 | Phase 5 | Research complete (see completion gate) |

### State Transitions

| Transition | Trigger |
|------------|---------|
| RESEARCH → CHECKPOINT | When context becomes heavy or research is extensive |
| CHECKPOINT → RESEARCH | After saving, continue with compressed context |
| OUTPUT → PLAN/RESEARCH | If user says "continue researching" |

**CRITICAL REMINDER: Run Self-Check after each action to verify you're on track.**

Each phase MUST complete before proceeding to the next. **FORBIDDEN**: Skipping phases without explicit fast-path qualification.

---

## Phase 1: Server Initialization

### Server Configuration

<server>
   <description>MCP-like implementation over http://localhost:1987</description>
   <port>1987</port>
</server>

### Available Routes

<server_routes>

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| GET | `/tools/initContext` | System prompt + all tool schemas (LOAD FIRST!) |
| GET | `/prompts/info/:promptName` | Get prompt content and arguments |
| POST | `/tools/call/:toolName` | Execute a tool (JSON body with queries array) |

</server_routes>

### Initialization Process

<server_init_gate>
**HALT. Server MUST be running before ANY other action.**

#### Required Action

Run from the skill's base directory (provided in system message as "Base directory for this skill: ..."):

```bash
cd <SKILL_BASE_DIRECTORY> && npm run server-init
```

**Example**: If system message says `Base directory for this skill: /path/to/skill`, run:
```bash
cd /path/to/skill && npm run server-init
```

#### Output Interpretation

| Output | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `ok` | Server ready | **PROCEED** to Phase 2 (LOAD CONTEXT) |
| `ERROR: ...` | Server failed | **STOP.** Report error to user. DO NOT proceed. |

The script handles health checks, startup, and waiting automatically with mutex lock.

#### FORBIDDEN Until Server Returns "ok"
- Any tool calls to localhost:1987 or research tools

#### ALLOWED Before Server Ready
- Checking "Base directory for this skill" in system message
- Running `server-init` command
- Troubleshooting commands (lsof, kill)

#### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `Missing script: server-init` | Wrong directory | **STOP.** Check "Base directory for this skill" in system message |
| Health check fails | Server starting | Wait a few seconds, retry `curl http://localhost:1987/health` |
| Port 1987 in use | Previous instance | Run `lsof -i :1987` then `kill <PID>` |

#### Retry Policy

On failure, retry a few times with reasonable delays. If retries are exhausted, **STOP** and report to user.

**FORBIDDEN**: Retrying indefinitely without timeout.
**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding after retries exhausted.

**→ PROCEED TO PHASE 2 ONLY AFTER SERVER RETURNS "ok"**
</server_init_gate>

### Server Maintenance

<server_maintenance>
App logs with rotation at `~/.octocode/logs/` (errors.log, tools.log).
</server_maintenance>

---

## Phase 2: Load Context

<context_gate>
**STOP. DO NOT call any research tools yet.**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Server returned "ok" in Phase 1

### Context Loading Checklist (MANDATORY - Complete ALL steps)

| # | Step | Command | Output to User |
|---|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Load context | `curl http://localhost:1987/tools/initContext` | "Context loaded" |
| 2 | Choose prompt | Match user intent → prompt table below | "Using `{prompt}` prompt for this research" |
| 3 | Load prompt | `curl http://localhost:1987/prompts/info/{prompt}` | - |
| 4 | Confirm ready | Read & understand prompt instructions | "Ready to plan research" |

### FORBIDDEN Until Context Loaded
- Any research tools

### ALLOWED During Context Loading
- `curl` commands to localhost:1987
- Text output to user
- Reading tool schemas
</context_gate>

### Understanding Tool Schemas

<context_understanding>
**CRITICAL: STOP after loading context. The tools teach themselves - learn from them.**

The `initContext` response contains everything you need:
1. **System prompt** - Overall guidance and constraints
2. **Tool schemas** - Required params, types, constraints, descriptions
3. **Quick reference** - Decision patterns for common scenarios

#### Schema Parsing (MUST do before ANY tool call)

1. **Read the description** - What does this tool ACTUALLY do?
2. **Check required fields** - What MUST be provided? (missing = error)
3. **Check types & constraints** - enums, min/max, patterns
4. **Check defaults** - What happens if optional fields omitted?

#### Parameter Discipline

<parameter_rules>
**CRITICAL - These are NON-NEGOTIABLE:**
- **NEVER** invent values for required parameters
- **NEVER** use placeholders or guessed values
- **IF** required value unknown → **THEN** use another tool to find it first
</parameter_rules>

#### Verification (REQUIRED)

After loading, you MUST verbalize:
> "Context loaded. I understand the schemas and will think on best research approach"

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without this verbalization.
</context_understanding>

### Prompt Selection

<prompt_selection>

| PromptName | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|
| `research` | External libraries, GitHub repos, packages |
| `research_local` | Local codebase exploration |
| `reviewPR` | PR URLs, review requests |
| `plan` | Bug fixes, features, refactors |
| `roast` | Poetic code roasting (load `references/roast-prompt.md`) |

**REQUIRED**: You MUST tell user which prompt you're using:
> "I'm using the `{promptName}` prompt because [reason]"

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding to next phase without stating the prompt.
</prompt_selection>

<context_complete_gate>
**HALT. Verify ALL conditions before proceeding:**

- [ ] Context loaded successfully?
- [ ] Tool schemas understood?
- [ ] Told user which prompt you're using?
- [ ] Verbalized: "Context loaded. I understand the schemas..."?

**IF ANY checkbox is unchecked → STOP. Complete missing items.**
**IF ALL checkboxes checked → PROCEED to Phase 2.5 (Fast-Path Evaluation)**
</context_complete_gate>

---

## Phase 2.5: Fast-Path Evaluation

**CRITICAL: Evaluate BEFORE creating a plan. This saves time for simple queries.**

### Fast-Path Decision

<fast_path_gate>
**STOP. Evaluate these criteria:**

#### Criteria (ALL must be TRUE for fast-path)

| Criteria | Check | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Single-point lookup | "Where is X defined?", "What is X?", "Show me Y" | ✓ "Where is formatDate?" ✗ "How does auth flow work?" |
| One file/location expected | NOT cross-repository, NOT multi-subsystem | ✓ Same repo, same service ✗ Tracing calls across services |
| Few tool calls needed | Search → Read OR Search → LSP → Done | ✓ Find definition ✗ Trace full execution path |
| Target is unambiguous | Symbol is unique, no version/language ambiguity | ✓ Clear target ✗ Overloaded names, multiple versions |

#### Decision Logic

**IF ALL criteria are TRUE:**
1. Tell user: "This is a simple lookup. Proceeding directly to research."
2. **SKIP** Phase 3 (Planning)
3. **GO TO** Phase 4 (Research) - skip `research_gate` pre-conditions

**IF ANY criterion is FALSE:**
1. Tell user: "This requires planning. Creating research plan..."
2. **PROCEED** to Phase 3 (Planning)
</fast_path_gate>

### Examples

#### Qualifies for Fast-Path (ALL criteria TRUE)
- "Where is `formatDate` defined in this repo?" → Search → LSP goto → Done
- "What does the `validateEmail` function do?" → Search → Read → Done
- "Show me the User model" → Search → Read → Done

#### Requires Full Planning (ANY criterion FALSE)
- "How does React useState flow work?" → Needs PLAN (traces multiple files)
- "How does authentication flow work?" → Needs PLAN (multi-file)
- "Compare React vs Vue state management" → Needs PLAN (multiple domains)

---

## Phase 3: Planning

<plan_gate>
### STOP. DO NOT call any research tools.

#### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Context loaded (`/tools/initContext`)
- [ ] User intent identified
- [ ] Fast-path evaluated (criteria checked)

#### Required Actions (MUST complete ALL)

1. **Identify Domains**: List research areas/files to explore.
2. **Draft Steps**: Create a structured plan with clear milestones.
   **REQUIRED**: Use your TodoWrite tool.
3. **Evaluate Parallelization**:
   - **IF** multiple independent domains → **MUST** spawn parallel Task agents.
   - **IF** single domain → Sequential execution.
4. **Share Plan**: Present the plan to the user in this EXACT format:

```markdown
## Research Plan
**Goal:** [User's question]
**Strategy:** [Sequential / Parallel]
**Steps:**
1. [Tool] → [Specific Goal]
2. [Tool] → [Specific Goal]
...
**Estimated scope:** [files/repos to explore]

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**FORBIDDEN**: Deviating from this format.

#### FORBIDDEN Until Plan Approved
- Any research tools

#### ALLOWED During Planning
- `TodoWrite` (to draft plan)
- `AskUserQuestion` (to confirm)
- Text output (to present plan)

#### Gate Verification

**HALT. Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] Plan created in `TodoWrite`?
- [ ] Plan presented to user in EXACT format above?
- [ ] Parallelization strategy selected?
- [ ] **User approval obtained?** (said "yes", "go", "proceed", or similar)

**WAIT for user response. DO NOT proceed without explicit approval.**

**IF user approves → PROCEED to Phase 4 (Research)**
**IF user requests changes → Modify plan and re-present**
**IF user rejects → Ask for clarification**
</plan_gate>

### Parallel Execution Decision

<parallel_decision>
**CRITICAL: Multiple independent domains → MUST spawn Task agents in parallel**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Single question, single domain | Sequential OK |
| Multiple domains / repos / subsystems | **MUST use Parallel Task agents** |

```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", model="opus", prompt="Domain A: [goal]")
Task(subagent_type="Explore", model="opus", prompt="Domain B: [goal]")
→ Merge findings
```

**FORBIDDEN**: Sequential execution when multiple independent domains are identified.
</parallel_decision>

### Domain Classification

<domain_definition>
**What counts as a "domain"?**

| Separate Domains (→ Parallel) | Same Domain (→ Sequential) |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Different repositories (react vs vue) | Same repo, different files |
| Different services (auth-service vs payment-service) | Same service, different modules |
| Different languages/runtimes (frontend JS vs backend Python) | Same language, different packages |
| Different owners (facebook/react vs vuejs/vue) | Same owner, related repos |
| Unrelated subsystems (logging vs caching) | Related layers (API → DB) |

#### Classification Examples

**Parallel** (multiple domains):
> "Compare how React and Vue handle state"
> → Domain A: React state (facebook/react)
> → Domain B: Vue state (vuejs/vue)

**Sequential** (single domain):
> "How does React useState flow from export to reconciler?"
> → Same repo (facebook/react), tracing through files
> → Files are connected, not independent

**Parallel** (multiple domains):
> "How does our auth service communicate with the user service?"
> → Domain A: auth-service repo
> → Domain B: user-service repo
</domain_definition>

### Agent Selection

<agent_selection>
**Agent & Model Selection** (model is suggestion - use most suitable):

| Task Type | Agent | Suggested Model |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Deep exploration | `Explore` | `opus` |
| Quick lookup | `Explore` | `haiku` |

Agent capabilities are defined by the tools loaded in context.
</agent_selection>

### Parallel Agent Protocol

→ See [`references/PARALLEL_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`](references/PARALLEL_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md)

---

## Phase 4: Research Execution

<research_gate>
### STOP. Verify entry conditions.

#### IF Coming from PLAN Phase:
- [ ] Plan presented to user?
- [ ] `TodoWrite` completed?
- [ ] Parallel strategy evaluated?
- [ ] **User approved the plan?**

#### IF Coming from FAST-PATH:
- [ ] Told user "simple lookup, proceeding directly"?
- [ ] Context was loaded?

**IF ANY pre-condition not met → STOP. Go back to appropriate phase.**
**IF ALL pre-conditions met → PROCEED with research.**
</research_gate>

### The Research Loop

<research_loop>
**CRITICAL: Follow this loop for EVERY research action:**

1. **Execute Tool** with required research params (see Global Constraints)
2. **Read Response** - check `hints` FIRST
3. **Verbalize Hints** - tell user what hints suggest
4. **Follow Hints** - they guide the next tool/action
5. **Iterate** until goal achieved

**FORBIDDEN**: Ignoring hints in tool responses.
**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without verbalizing hints.
</research_loop>

### Hint Handling

<hint_handling>
**MANDATORY: You MUST understand hints and think how they can help with research.**

| Hint Type | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Next tool suggestion | **MUST** use the recommended tool |
| Pagination | Fetch next page if needed |
| Refinement needed | Narrow the search |
| Error guidance | Recover as indicated |

**FORBIDDEN**: Ignoring hints.
**FORBIDDEN**: Using a different tool than hints suggest (unless you explain why).
</hint_handling>

### Thought Process

<thought_process>
**CRITICAL: Follow this reasoning pattern:**

- **Stop & Understand**: Clearly identify user intent. **IF unclear → STOP and ASK.**
- **Think Before Acting**: Verify context (what do I know? what is missing?). Does this step serve the `mainResearchGoal`?
- **Plan**: Think through steps thoroughly. Understand tool connections.
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Share your plan, reasoning ("why"), and discoveries with the user.
- **Adherence**: Follow prompt instructions. Include required research params (see Global Constraints).
- **Data-driven**: Follow tool schemas and hints (see Phase 2 Parameter Rules).
- **Stuck or Unsure?**: **IF** looping, hitting dead ends, or path is ambiguous → **STOP and ASK the user**.
</thought_process>

### Error Recovery

<error_recovery>
**IF/THEN Recovery Rules:**

| Error Type | Recovery Action |
|------------|-----------------|
| Empty results | **IF** empty → **THEN** broaden pattern, try semantic variants |
| Timeout | **IF** timeout → **THEN** reduce scope/depth |
| Rate limit | **IF** rate limited → **THEN** back off, batch fewer queries |
| Dead end | **IF** dead end → **THEN** backtrack, try alternate approach |
| Looping | **IF** stuck on same tool repeatedly → **THEN STOP** → re-read hints → ask user |

**CRITICAL: IF stuck and not making progress → STOP and ask user for guidance.**
</error_recovery>

### Context Management

<context_management>
**Rule: Checkpoint when context becomes heavy or research is extensive.** Save to `.octocode/research/{session-id}/checkpoint-{N}.md`

#### Checkpoint Content
Save: goal, key findings (file:line), open questions, next steps. Tell user: "Created checkpoint."

#### Session Files
```
.octocode/research/{session-id}/
├── session.json    # {id, state, mainResearchGoal}
├── checkpoint-*.md # Checkpoints
├── domain-*.md     # Parallel agent outputs
└── research.md     # Final output
```

#### Resume
If `session.json` exists with state ≠ DONE → Ask user: "Resume from last checkpoint?" → Yes: load & continue, No: fresh start.

#### What to Keep/Discard After Checkpoint

| KEEP | DISCARD |
|------|---------|
| File:line refs | Full tool JSON |
| Key findings | Intermediate results |
| Brief code snippets | Verbose hints |
</context_management>

### Research Completion

<research_complete_gate>
**HALT. Before proceeding to OUTPUT, verify completion.**

#### Completion Triggers (ANY one triggers OUTPUT)

| Trigger | Evidence | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Goal achieved | Answer found with file:line refs | → PROCEED to Phase 5 |
| Stuck (exhausted) | Multiple recovery attempts failed | → PROCEED to Phase 5 (note gaps) |
| User satisfied | User says "enough" or "looks good" | → PROCEED to Phase 5 |
| Scope complete | All planned domains/files explored | → PROCEED to Phase 5 |

#### Trigger Precedence (if multiple fire simultaneously)

| Priority | Trigger | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 (highest) | Goal achieved | Mission complete, no need to continue |
| 2 | User satisfied | User input overrides scope checks |
| 3 | Scope complete | Planned work done |
| 4 (lowest) | Stuck (exhausted) | Fallback when blocked; note gaps in output |

**FORBIDDEN**: Ending research arbitrarily without a trigger.
**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding to OUTPUT without file:line evidence.

#### Pre-Output Checklist

- [ ] Completion trigger identified?
- [ ] Key findings have file:line references?
- [ ] Checkpoints saved if research was extensive?
- [ ] TodoWrite items marked complete?

**IF ALL checked → PROCEED to Phase 5 (OUTPUT)**
**IF ANY unchecked → Complete missing items first**
</research_complete_gate>

---

## Phase 5: Output

<output_gate>
### STOP. Verify entry conditions and ensure output quality.

#### Entry Verification (from Phase 4)

- [ ] Completion trigger met? (goal achieved / stuck / user satisfied / scope complete)
- [ ] Key findings documented with file:line refs?
- [ ] TodoWrite items updated?

**IF parallel agents were spawned:**
- [ ] All domain-*.md files read and incorporated?
- [ ] Merge gate completed? (see `references/PARALLEL_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`)
- [ ] Conflicts resolved or user acknowledged?

**IF ANY entry condition not met → RETURN to Phase 4 (Research) or complete merge.**

#### Required Response Structure (MANDATORY - Include ALL sections)

1. **TL;DR**: Clear summary (a few sentences).
2. **Details**: In-depth analysis with evidence.
3. **References**: ALL code citations with proper format (see below).
4. **Next Step**: **REQUIRED** question (see below).

**FORBIDDEN**: Skipping any section. TL;DR, Details, References, and Next Step are always required.

#### IF Research is STUCK (goal not achieved)

When entering Phase 5 via "Stuck (exhausted)" trigger, adapt output format:

| Section | Adaptation |
|---------|------------|
| **TL;DR** | Start with "[INCOMPLETE]" - e.g., "[INCOMPLETE] Investigated X, but Y remains unclear due to Z" |
| **Details** | Include: attempts made, blockers hit, partial findings with file:line refs |
| **References** | Include all files explored, even if inconclusive |
| **Next Step** | MUST offer: "Continue researching [specific blocked area]?" OR "Need clarification on [X]?" |

**Example Stuck TL;DR**: "[INCOMPLETE] Traced authentication flow to `auth/middleware.ts:42`, but token validation logic at `auth/jwt.ts:88-120` uses external service not accessible."

#### Reference Format (MUST follow EXACTLY)

| Research Type | Format | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **GitHub/External** | Full URL with line numbers | `https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react/src/ReactHooks.js#L66-L69` |
| **Local codebase** | `path:line` format | `src/components/Button.tsx:42` |
| **Multiple lines** | Range notation | `src/utils/auth.ts:15-28` |

**Why full GitHub URLs?** Users can click to navigate directly. Partial paths are ambiguous across branches/forks.

**FORBIDDEN**: Relative GitHub paths without full URL.
**FORBIDDEN**: Missing line numbers in references.

#### Next Step Question (MANDATORY)

You **MUST** end the session by asking ONE of these:
- "Create a research doc?" (Save to `.octocode/research/{session}/research.md`)
- "Continue researching [specific area]?"
- "Any clarifications needed?"

**FORBIDDEN**: Ending silently without a question.
**FORBIDDEN**: Ending with just "Let me know if you need anything else."

#### Gate Verification

**HALT. Before sending output, verify:**
- [ ] TL;DR included?
- [ ] Details with evidence included?
- [ ] ALL references have proper format?
- [ ] Next step question included?

**IF ANY checkbox unchecked → Add the missing element before sending.**
</output_gate>

---

## Cross-Cutting: Self-Check

<agent_self_check>
**After each tool call:** Hints followed? On track?
**Periodically:** TodoWrite updated? User informed of progress?
**If stuck:** STOP and ask user.

**Phase gates:** Server "ok" → Context + prompt stated → Fast-path evaluated → Plan approved → Research (follow hints) → Checkpoint when needed → Output (TL;DR + refs + question)

**Multi-domain?** → See `references/PARALLEL_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`
</agent_self_check>

---

## Reference: Global Constraints

<global_constraints>
### Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **ALWAYS understand before acting** - Read tool schemas from context before calling
2. **ALWAYS follow hints** - See Phase 4 for hint handling protocol
3. **ALWAYS be data-driven** - Let data guide you (see Phase 2 Parameter Rules)
4. **NEVER guess** - If value unknown, find it first with another tool

### Research Params (REQUIRED in EVERY tool call)

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `mainResearchGoal` | Overall objective |
| `researchGoal` | This specific step's goal |
| `reasoning` | Why this tool/params |

**FORBIDDEN**: Tool calls without these three parameters.

### Execution Rules

See Phase 3 for parallel execution strategy.

### Output Standards

See Phase 5 (Output Gate) for reference formats.
