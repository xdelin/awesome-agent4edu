### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Check existing PRs and issues** first
2. **Discuss major changes** in an issue before starting
3. **Keep PRs focused** - one feature/fix per PR
4. **Include tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Follow the style guide**

## Development Process

### 1. Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-graph-embedding` - New features
- `fix/memory-leak-in-flow` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-api-reference` - Documentation
- `refactor/simplify-algorithms` - Code refactoring
- `test/add-clustering-tests` - Test additions

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Sync with upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# 4. Run tests frequently
pytest tests/test_relevant_module.py

# 5. Check code quality
black src/ tests/
ruff check src/ tests/
mypy src/

# 6. Commit changes
git add -p  # Stage changes interactively
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"

# 7. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Code Organization

Follow the existing project structure:

```
src/networkx_mcp/
├── core/              # Core functionality
├── advanced/          # Advanced analytics
│   ├── community/     # Community detection
│   └── ml/           # Machine learning
├── visualization/     # Visualization backends
├── io/               # I/O operations
├── interfaces/       # Public APIs
└── utils/            # Utilities
```

When adding new features:

- Put algorithms in appropriate category
- Create new subdirectories for major features
- Keep files focused and under 500 lines
- Use clear, descriptive names

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style

We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting and [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting.

#### Code Style Rules

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear, typed, documented
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
import networkx as nx


def calculate_modularity(
    graph: nx.Graph,
    communities: List[List[str]],
    weight: Optional[str] = None
) -> float:
    """Calculate modularity of community partition.

    Args:
        graph: Input graph
        communities: List of node communities
        weight: Edge weight attribute name

    Returns:
        Modularity score between -1 and 1

    Raises:
        ValueError: If communities overlap
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass


# ❌ Bad: Unclear, untyped, undocumented
def calc_mod(g, comms, w=None):
    # calculate modularity
    pass
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Type hints**: Always use type hints
2. **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
3. **Variable names**: Be descriptive (`node_count` not `n`)
4. **Functions**: Keep them small and focused
5. **Error handling**: Raise specific exceptions with clear messages
6. **Constants**: Use UPPER_CASE for module-level constants

### Testing Style

```python
# ✅ Good: Descriptive, isolated, comprehensive
import pytest
import networkx as nx
from networkx_mcp.algorithms import find_shortest_path


class TestShortestPath:
    """Test shortest path algorithms."""

    def test_simple_path(self):
        """Test shortest path in simple graph."""
        # Arrange
        graph = nx.Graph()
        graph.add_edges_from([("A", "B"), ("B", "C")])

        # Act
        path = find_shortest_path(graph, "A", "C")

        # Assert
        assert path == ["A", "B", "C"]

    def test_no_path_exists(self):
        """Test when no path exists between nodes."""
        graph = nx.Graph()
        graph.add_nodes_from(["A", "B"])

        with pytest.raises(nx.NetworkXNoPath):
            find_shortest_path(graph, "A", "B")

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("weight,expected", [
        ("weight", ["A", "C"]),
        (None, ["A", "B", "C"]),
    ])
    def test_weighted_paths(self, weight, expected):
        """Test paths with different weight configurations."""
        # Test implementation
```

## Documentation

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def complex_function(
    graph: nx.Graph,
    source: str,
    target: str,
    weight: str = "weight",
    cutoff: Optional[int] = None
) -> List[str]:
    """Find shortest path between source and target.

    This function implements Dijkstra's algorithm with optimizations
    for sparse graphs. It handles both weighted and unweighted graphs.

    Args:
        graph: NetworkX graph instance
        source: Starting node for path
        target: Ending node for path
        weight: Name of edge attribute to use as weight.
            If None, all edges have weight 1.
        cutoff: Depth to stop the search. Only paths of
            length <= cutoff are returned.

    Returns:
        List of nodes representing the shortest path.
        Empty list if no path exists.

    Raises:
        NodeNotFound: If source or target not in graph
        ValueError: If weight attribute doesn't exist

    Examples:
        >>> G = nx.Graph()
        >>> G.add_edges_from([('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')])
        >>> complex_function(G, 'A', 'C')
        ['A', 'B', 'C']

    Note:
        For graphs with negative weights, use Bellman-Ford
        algorithm instead.
    """
```
