# Post-Deployment Checklist - Realistic Version

⚠️ **CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**: This checklist reflects what can **actually be validated** with the current implementation. Many standard MCP server checks **cannot be performed** until the MCP protocol is fully implemented.

## 🎯 **Pre-Deployment Reality Check**

### ❌ **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS** (Must be fixed first)

- [ ] **MCP Protocol Implementation**: Does NOT exist - server cannot communicate with MCP clients
- [ ] **server_minimal.py**: Does NOT exist - referenced in `__main__.py` but missing
- [ ] **Functional stdio transport**: Transport layer exists but is NOT functional
- [ ] **JSON-RPC handler**: Incomplete implementation
- [ ] **Claude Desktop compatibility**: IMPOSSIBLE until MCP protocol works

### ✅ **What CAN Be Deployed**

- [ ] **Graph operations infrastructure**: Core NetworkX functionality
- [ ] **Monitoring stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager
- [ ] **Health check endpoints**: Basic HTTP health checks
- [ ] **Security validation**: Input validation and sanitization

---

## 📋 **Realistic Deployment Checklist**

### 🔧 **Infrastructure Validation** (Actually Testable)

#### Kubernetes Infrastructure

- [ ] **All pods healthy**: `kubectl get pods -l app=networkx-mcp` shows Running status
- [ ] **No CrashLoopBackOff**: Pods aren't repeatedly crashing due to missing files
- [ ] **Container images built**: Images contain all required code (check for missing files)
- [ ] **Resource limits set**: Memory and CPU limits configured appropriately
- [ ] **Persistent volumes**: Storage configured if using persistent graph storage

#### Health Endpoints (These Actually Work)

- [ ] **Health endpoint accessible**: `curl http://SERVICE_IP:8080/health` returns 200
- [ ] **Ready endpoint accessible**: `curl http://SERVICE_IP:8080/ready` returns 200
- [ ] **Metrics endpoint accessible**: `curl http://SERVICE_IP:9090/metrics` returns Prometheus metrics

### 📊 **Monitoring Stack** (Fully Functional)

#### Prometheus Metrics

- [ ] **Metrics scraping**: Prometheus successfully scraping metrics from pods
- [ ] **Custom metrics present**: `mcp_*` metrics appearing in Prometheus
- [ ] **No scraping errors**: Prometheus targets show as "UP"
- [ ] **Historical data**: Metrics being stored and queryable

#### Grafana Dashboard

- [ ] **Dashboard accessible**: Grafana UI loads without errors
- [ ] **Panels showing data**: All dashboard panels display real metrics data
- [ ] **No "No Data" panels**: All configured metrics are being collected
- [ ] **Alert annotations**: Alert firing/resolving annotations visible

#### AlertManager

- [ ] **Alert rules loaded**: Prometheus rules loaded without syntax errors
- [ ] **AlertManager healthy**: AlertManager UI accessible and showing rules
- [ ] **Notification routing**: Test alerts route to correct channels (Slack/email)

### 🧪 **Core Functionality** (What Actually Works)

#### Graph Operations (Direct Testing)

```bash
# Test script that actually works:
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('src')
from networkx_mcp.core.graph_operations import GraphManager

manager = GraphManager()
result = manager.create_graph('deploy_test', directed=True)
assert result['success'], 'Graph creation failed'

manager.add_nodes('deploy_test', ['A', 'B', 'C'])
manager.add_edges('deploy_test', [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')])

info = manager.get_graph_info('deploy_test')
assert info['nodes'] == 3, f'Expected 3 nodes, got {info[\"nodes\"]}'
assert info['edges'] == 2, f'Expected 2 edges, got {info[\"edges\"]}'

manager.delete_graph('deploy_test')
print('✅ Core graph operations working')
"
```

- [ ] **Graph creation works**: Can create graphs without errors
- [ ] **Node operations work**: Can add/remove nodes successfully
- [ ] **Edge operations work**: Can add/remove edges successfully
- [ ] **Graph queries work**: Can retrieve graph information
- [ ] **Graph deletion works**: Can clean up graphs properly

#### Algorithm Functionality (Direct Testing)

```bash
# Test algorithms directly:
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('src')
from networkx_mcp.core.graph_operations import GraphManager
from networkx_mcp.advanced.algorithms import GraphAlgorithms

manager = GraphManager()
algorithms = GraphAlgorithms(manager)

manager.create_graph('algo_test', directed=False)
manager.add_nodes('algo_test', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
manager.add_edges('algo_test', [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'D')])

path_result = algorithms.shortest_path('algo_test', 'A', 'D')
assert path_result['success'], 'Shortest path failed'

centrality_result = algorithms.centrality_measures('algo_test', ['degree'])
assert centrality_result['success'], 'Centrality calculation failed'

manager.delete_graph('algo_test')
print('✅ Graph algorithms working')
"
```

- [ ] **Shortest path algorithms**: Basic pathfinding works
- [ ] **Centrality measures**: Degree centrality calculations work
- [ ] **Algorithm error handling**: Graceful failure for invalid inputs

### 🚫 **What CANNOT Be Tested** (Until MCP Protocol Complete)

#### MCP Protocol Compliance ❌

- [ ] ~~Claude Desktop can connect~~ - **IMPOSSIBLE**: No MCP protocol
- [ ] ~~MCP stdio mode works~~ - **IMPOSSIBLE**: Transport not functional
- [ ] ~~JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance~~ - **IMPOSSIBLE**: Handler incomplete
- [ ] ~~Tool discovery works~~ - **IMPOSSIBLE**: No MCP integration
- [ ] ~~Resource listing works~~ - **IMPOSSIBLE**: No MCP integration

#### Client Integration ❌

- [ ] ~~Python SDK client works~~ - **IMPOSSIBLE**: No working server to connect to
- [ ] ~~MCP client libraries connect~~ - **IMPOSSIBLE**: Protocol not implemented
- [ ] ~~Load balancer distributing traffic evenly~~ - **MEANINGLESS**: No real traffic

#### Performance Metrics ❌

- [ ] ~~Response time P95 < 200ms~~ - **UNMEASURABLE**: No MCP requests to time
- [ ] ~~Active connections < 40~~ - **MEANINGLESS**: No real connections
- [ ] ~~Concurrent user handling~~ - **UNTESTABLE**: No real users can connect

## 🎯 **Realistic Success Criteria**

### ✅ **Deployment Success** (What You Can Actually Achieve)

1. **Infrastructure deployed**: Pods running, health checks passing
2. **Monitoring operational**: Metrics collected, dashboards working
3. **Core functionality**: Graph operations work via direct Python integration
4. **Security validated**: Input validation and error handling work
5. **Ready for MCP integration**: Infrastructure ready for protocol implementation

### ⚠️ **Deployment Limitations** (Honest Assessment)

1. **Cannot serve MCP clients**: Core purpose not yet functional
2. **No real user traffic**: Cannot handle actual MCP requests
3. **Performance unknown**: No real load testing possible
4. **Integration incomplete**: Cannot be used by Claude Desktop or other tools

```

## 🚨 **Critical Post-Deployment Actions**

### If You Deploy Anyway (Infrastructure Only)

1. **Document limitations**: Clearly communicate what doesn't work
2. **Block MCP traffic**: Ensure no clients try to connect until ready
3. **Monitor for errors**: Watch for crashes due to missing implementation
4. **Plan completion**: Set realistic timeline for MCP protocol completion

### Before Claiming "Production Ready"

1. **Complete MCP protocol**: Implement missing transport and handler
2. **Test with real clients**: Validate Claude Desktop integration
3. **Performance validation**: Get real metrics with actual load
4. **Security review**: MCP-specific security validation
