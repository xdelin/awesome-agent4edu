## Quick Health Check (Run First)

Score each signal 0-2 (0 = broken, 1 = needs work, 2 = healthy):

| Signal | What to Check |
|--------|--------------|
| 🔀 Branching | Clear strategy, branches short-lived (<5 days avg) |
| 📝 Commits | Conventional commits, atomic changes, clean history |
| 👀 Code Review | PRs reviewed <24h, clear approval rules, no rubber-stamping |
| 🚀 Release | Automated releases, tagged versions, changelog generated |
| 🔄 CI Integration | Pre-merge checks pass, branch protection enforced |
| 🧹 Hygiene | No stale branches, .gitignore complete, secrets never committed |
| 📊 Monorepo/Multi-repo | Appropriate strategy for team size, clear ownership |
| 🔒 Security | Signed commits, no secrets in history, access controls |

**Score: /16** → 0-6: Crisis | 7-10: Needs attention | 11-13: Good | 14-16: Excellent

## Phase 1: Branching Strategy Selection

### Strategy Comparison Matrix

| Strategy | Best For | Team Size | Release Cadence | Complexity |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **GitHub Flow** | SaaS, continuous deploy | 1-15 | Daily/on-demand | Low |
| **GitFlow** | Packaged software, versioned releases | 5-50 | Scheduled (2-6 wk) | High |
| **Trunk-Based** | High-performing teams, CI/CD mature | 5-100+ | Multiple/day | Low |
| **GitLab Flow** | Environment-based deploys | 5-30 | Environment-triggered | Medium |
| **Release Flow** | Large monorepos (Microsoft-style) | 50+ | Scheduled + hotfix | Medium |
| **Ship/Show/Ask** | High-trust, mixed urgency | 3-20 | Continuous | Low |

### Decision Tree

```
Q1: How often do you deploy to production?
├─ Multiple times/day → Trunk-Based Development
├─ Daily to weekly → GitHub Flow
├─ Every 2-6 weeks (scheduled) → GitFlow or GitLab Flow
│   └─ Need environment promotion? → GitLab Flow
│   └─ Need parallel release support? → GitFlow
└─ Infrequently / packaged software → GitFlow
```

### Branch Naming Convention

```yaml
branch_naming:
  pattern: "{type}/{ticket}-{short-description}"
  types:
    - feat     # New feature
    - fix      # Bug fix
    - hotfix   # Production emergency
    - chore    # Maintenance, deps
    - docs     # Documentation
    - refactor # Code restructure
    - test     # Test additions
    - perf     # Performance
  examples:
    - "feat/PROJ-123-user-authentication"
    - "fix/PROJ-456-login-timeout"
    - "hotfix/PROJ-789-payment-crash"
  rules:
    - lowercase only, hyphens for spaces
    - max 50 characters after type/
    - always include ticket number
    - delete after merge (automated)
```

### Branch Lifetime Targets

| Branch Type | Target Lifetime | Max Lifetime | Action if Exceeded |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Feature | 1-3 days | 5 days | Split into smaller PRs |
| Bugfix | <1 day | 2 days | Prioritize review |
| Hotfix | <4 hours | 1 day | Emergency review process |
| Release | 1-3 days | 1 week | Only bug fixes, no features |

---

## Phase 2: Commit Engineering

### Conventional Commits Standard

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Type Reference:**

| Type | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(auth): add SSO login` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(api): handle null response` |
| `perf` | Performance | `perf(db): add index on users.email` |
| `refactor` | No behavior change | `refactor(auth): extract token service` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(api): add endpoint examples` |
| `test` | Tests only | `test(auth): add SSO edge cases` |
| `chore` | Build/tooling | `chore(deps): bump lodash to 4.17.21` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | `ci: add coverage threshold check` |
| `style` | Formatting only | `style: apply prettier` |
| `revert` | Revert previous | `revert: feat(auth): add SSO login` |

**Breaking Changes:**
```
feat(api)!: change auth header format

BREAKING CHANGE: Authorization header now requires "Bearer " prefix.
Migration: Update all API clients to include "Bearer " before token.
```

### Commit Quality Rules

1. **Atomic commits** — one logical change per commit
2. **Imperative mood** — "add feature" not "added feature"
3. **Subject line ≤72 chars** — fits in git log
4. **Body wraps at 72 chars** — readable in terminal
5. **Reference issues** — `Fixes #123` or `Refs PROJ-456`
6. **No WIP commits on main** — squash or interactive rebase first
7. **Sign commits** — `git config commit.gpgsign true`

### Interactive Rebase Before Merge

```bash
# Clean up feature branch before PR
git rebase -i main

# Common operations:
# pick   → keep commit as-is
# squash → combine with previous
# fixup  → combine, discard message
# reword → change commit message
# drop   → remove commit entirely

# Golden rule: Never rebase shared/public branches
```

### Commit Message Template

```yaml
# .gitmessage template
commit_template: |
  # <type>(<scope>): <subject>
  #
  # Why this change?
  #
  # What changed?
  #
  # Refs: PROJ-XXX
  #
  # Types: feat|fix|perf|refactor|docs|test|chore|ci|style|revert
  # Breaking: add ! after type or BREAKING CHANGE: in footer
```

---

## Phase 3: Code Review & Pull Request Workflow

### PR Template

```yaml
pr_template:
  title: "{type}({scope}): {description} [PROJ-XXX]"
  body: |
    ## What
    <!-- What does this PR do? One sentence. -->

    ## Why
    <!-- Why is this change needed? Link to issue/RFC. -->

    ## How
    <!-- Technical approach. Key decisions. -->

    ## Testing
    <!-- How was this tested? -->
    - [ ] Unit tests pass
    - [ ] Integration tests pass
    - [ ] Manual testing done
    - [ ] Edge cases covered

    ## Screenshots
    <!-- UI changes only -->

    ## Checklist
    - [ ] Self-reviewed my code
    - [ ] Added/updated tests
    - [ ] Updated documentation
    - [ ] No new warnings
    - [ ] Breaking changes documented
    - [ ] Migration guide included (if breaking)
  labels:
    size:
      xs: "<10 lines"
      s: "10-50 lines"
      m: "50-200 lines"
      l: "200-500 lines"
      xl: ">500 lines — consider splitting"
```

### PR Size Guidelines

| Size | Lines Changed | Review Time | Defect Rate |
|------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| XS | <10 | 5 min | ~0% |
| S | 10-50 | 15 min | ~5% |
| M | 50-200 | 30 min | ~15% |
| L | 200-500 | 60 min | ~25% |
| XL | >500 | 120+ min | ~40% |

**Rule: PRs >400 lines have 40% higher defect rate. Split aggressively.**

### Review SLAs

| Priority | First Review | Approval | Escalation |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Hotfix | 30 min | 1 hour | Page on-call |
| Critical | 2 hours | 4 hours | Slack team lead |
| Normal | 4 hours | 24 hours | Daily standup |
| Low | 24 hours | 48 hours | Weekly review |

### Review Quality Checklist

```yaml
review_checklist:
  correctness:
    - Does this solve the stated problem?
    - Are edge cases handled?
    - Could this break existing functionality?
  design:
    - Is the approach appropriate for the problem?
    - Does it follow existing patterns?
    - Is it the simplest solution that works?
  readability:
    - Can I understand this without the PR description?
    - Are names descriptive and consistent?
    - Are complex sections commented?
  testing:
    - Are tests meaningful (not just coverage padding)?
    - Do tests cover the happy path AND edge cases?
    - Are tests maintainable?
  security:
    - No hardcoded secrets or credentials
    - Input validation present
    - No SQL injection / XSS vectors
  performance:
    - No N+1 queries introduced
    - No unnecessary allocations in hot paths
    - Appropriate caching considered
```

### Review Comment Taxonomy

Prefix comments to clarify intent:

| Prefix | Meaning | Blocks Merge? |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `blocking:` | Must fix before merge | Yes |
| `suggestion:` | Consider this improvement | No |
| `nit:` | Style/formatting preference | No |
| `question:` | Need clarification | Maybe |
| `praise:` | Great work, learned something | No |
| `thought:` | Long-term consideration | No |

### Approval Rules by Change Type

| Change Type | Min Approvals | Required Reviewers | Auto-merge? |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Feature | 2 | 1 domain expert | No |
| Bug fix | 1 | Any team member | Optional |
| Hotfix | 1 | On-call + lead | After deploy |
| Refactor | 2 | Original author if available | No |
| Docs only | 1 | Any | Yes |
| Dependency update | 1 | Security-aware reviewer | Dependabot: yes |
| Config change | 2 | Ops + dev | No |
| Database migration | 2 | DBA/senior + 1 dev | No |

## Phase 4: Branch Protection & CI Integration

### Branch Protection Configuration

```yaml
branch_protection:
  main:
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    require_signed_commits: true
    require_linear_history: true  # No merge commits
    require_status_checks:
      - "ci/build"
      - "ci/test"
      - "ci/lint"
      - "ci/security-scan"
      - "ci/type-check"
    restrict_push: [release-bot]
    allow_force_push: false
    allow_deletions: false
    require_conversation_resolution: true

  develop:  # If using GitFlow
    required_reviews: 1
    require_status_checks:
      - "ci/build"
      - "ci/test"

  "release/*":
    required_reviews: 2
    restrict_push: [release-managers]
    allow_force_push: false
```

### Pre-merge CI Pipeline

```yaml
ci_pipeline:
  stages:
    - name: "Lint & Format"
      parallel: true
      checks:
        - eslint / ruff / clippy
        - prettier / black / gofmt
        - commitlint (conventional commits)
      target: "<30 seconds"

    - name: "Type Check"
      checks:
        - tsc --noEmit --strict
        - mypy / pyright
      target: "<60 seconds"

    - name: "Unit Tests"
      checks:
        - jest / pytest / go test
        - coverage threshold (≥80%)
      target: "<3 minutes"

    - name: "Integration Tests"
      checks:
        - API tests
        - Database migration test
      target: "<5 minutes"

    - name: "Security Scan"
      parallel: true
      checks:
        - dependency audit (npm audit / safety)
        - SAST (semgrep / CodeQL)
        - secrets detection (gitleaks / trufflehog)
      target: "<2 minutes"

    - name: "Build"
      checks:
        - Docker build
        - Bundle size check
      target: "<3 minutes"

  total_target: "<10 minutes"
  rules:
    - All checks must pass before merge
    - Flaky tests quarantined within 24h
    - New code must not decrease coverage
    - Security findings block merge (high/critical)
```

### CODEOWNERS Configuration

```
# .github/CODEOWNERS

# Default
* @team-leads

# Infrastructure
/infra/           @platform-team
/terraform/       @platform-team
/.github/         @platform-team
Dockerfile        @platform-team

# API
/src/api/         @backend-team
/src/middleware/   @backend-team

# Frontend
/src/components/  @frontend-team
/src/pages/       @frontend-team

# Database
/migrations/      @dba-team @backend-team

# Docs
/docs/            @docs-team

# Security-sensitive
/src/auth/        @security-team @backend-team
/src/crypto/      @security-team
```

---

## Phase 5: Release Management & Versioning

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-prerelease][+build]

Examples:
  1.0.0        → First stable release
  1.1.0        → New feature, backward compatible
  1.1.1        → Bug fix
  2.0.0        → Breaking change
  2.0.0-beta.1 → Pre-release
  2.0.0-rc.1   → Release candidate
```

### Version Bump Decision

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Breaking API change | MAJOR | Remove endpoint, change response shape |
| New feature (backward compatible) | MINOR | Add endpoint, new optional field |
| Bug fix | PATCH | Fix calculation error, typo |
| Performance improvement | PATCH | Optimize query (same behavior) |
| Dependency update (compatible) | PATCH | Bump lodash minor |
| Dependency update (breaking) | Depends | Evaluate downstream impact |

### Automated Release Pipeline

```yaml
release_pipeline:
  trigger: merge to main (or release branch)
  steps:
    1_version:
      tool: "semantic-release / release-please / changesets"
      action: "Determine version bump from commits"

    2_changelog:
      action: "Generate CHANGELOG.md from conventional commits"
      sections:
        - "🚀 Features" (feat)
        - "🐛 Bug Fixes" (fix)
        - "⚡ Performance" (perf)
        - "💥 Breaking Changes" (!)
        - "📝 Documentation" (docs)
        - "🔧 Maintenance" (chore)

    3_tag:
      action: "Create signed git tag"
      format: "v{major}.{minor}.{patch}"

    4_release:
      action: "Create GitHub Release with changelog"
      assets:
        - build artifacts
        - checksums

    5_publish:
      action: "Publish to package registry"
      registries:
        - npm / PyPI / Maven / Docker Hub

    6_notify:
      action: "Post to Slack #releases"
      template: "🚀 {package} v{version} released — {changelog_url}"
```

### Release Tool Comparison

| Tool | Approach | Monorepo | Config |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| **semantic-release** | Fully automated | Via plugins | .releaserc |
| **release-please** | PR-based | Native | release-please-config.json |
| **changesets** | Developer-driven | Native | .changeset/ |
| **standard-version** | Local CLI | No | .versionrc |
| **lerna** | Monorepo-specific | Yes | lerna.json |

**Selection Guide:**
- Want zero-touch automation? → semantic-release
- Want human review before release? → release-please
- Want developer-controlled changelogs? → changesets
- Monorepo with independent packages? → changesets or lerna

### Hotfix Process

```yaml
hotfix_process:
  trigger: "Production incident requiring code fix"
  steps:
    1: "Create branch from latest release tag: hotfix/PROJ-XXX-description"
    2: "Implement fix with test"
    3: "PR with 'hotfix' label → expedited review (1 reviewer)"
    4: "Merge to main AND release branch (if using GitFlow)"
    5: "Tag patch release immediately"
    6: "Deploy to production"
    7: "Cherry-pick to develop (if using GitFlow)"
    8: "Post-incident: add regression test to CI"
  sla: "Fix deployed within 4 hours of identification"
```

---

## Phase 6: Monorepo vs Multi-Repo Strategy

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Monorepo | Multi-Repo |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Code sharing** | Trivial (same tree) | Requires packages/versioning |
| **Refactoring** | Atomic cross-project changes | Coordinated multi-repo PRs |
| **CI complexity** | Higher (affected-only builds) | Simpler (per-repo pipelines) |
| **Dependency management** | Single lockfile, consistent | Independent, may drift |
| **Team autonomy** | Lower (shared conventions) | Higher (own rules) |
| **Onboarding** | One clone, full context | Clone what you need |
| **Build times** | Can grow large | Naturally bounded |
| **Access control** | Coarser (same repo) | Fine-grained (per-repo) |

### When to Use Each

**Monorepo When:**
- Shared libraries change frequently
- Teams need atomic cross-package changes
- Tight integration between services
- Strong shared tooling culture
- <50 active contributors OR excellent tooling

**Multi-Repo When:**
- Teams are autonomous (different stacks, cadences)
- Strong security boundaries needed
- Open source components mixed with private
- >100 contributors without monorepo tooling
- Microservices with stable API contracts

### Monorepo Tooling

| Tool | Language | Features | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Turborepo** | JS/TS | Fast, simple, caching | JS/TS monorepos |
| **Nx** | Any | Full-featured, generators | Large JS/TS + mixed |
| **Bazel** | Any | Hermetic, scalable | Google-scale, polyglot |
| **Pants** | Python, Go, Java | Incremental, remote cache | Python-heavy |
| **Rush** | JS/TS | Microsoft-backed | Enterprise JS/TS |
| **Lerna** | JS/TS | Publishing-focused | npm package sets |

### Monorepo Structure

```
/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/              # Next.js frontend
│   ├── api/              # Express backend

└── pnpm-workspace.yaml   # Workspace definition
```

### Affected-Only CI for Monorepos

```yaml
monorepo_ci:
  strategy: "Only build/test what changed"
  detection:
    - "git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD"
    - "Use tool-native affected detection (nx affected, turbo --filter)"
  caching:
    local: "node_modules/.cache, .turbo"
    remote: "S3/GCS for CI cache sharing"
    key: "hash of lockfile + source files"
  rules:
    - "Root config change → rebuild everything"
    - "Package change → rebuild package + dependents"
    - "App change → rebuild only that app"
    - "Docs change → skip build, only lint"
```

---

## Phase 7: Git Security

### Secrets Prevention

```yaml
secrets_prevention:
  pre_commit:
    tool: "gitleaks / trufflehog / detect-secrets"
    config: |
      # .gitleaks.toml
      [allowlist]
      paths = ["test/fixtures/**", "docs/examples/**"]

      [[rules]]
      id = "aws-access-key"
      description = "AWS Access Key"
      regex = '''AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}'''
      tags = ["aws", "credentials"]

  ci_scan:
    tool: "trufflehog --since-commit HEAD~1"
    action: "Block merge on detection"

  emergency_response:
    steps:
      1: "Revoke the exposed credential IMMEDIATELY"
      2: "git filter-repo to remove from history"
      3: "Force push cleaned history"
      4: "Audit access logs for the exposed credential"
      5: "Rotate all credentials that may have been exposed"
      6: "Add pattern to pre-commit hook"
    warning: |
      Even after removing from history, assume the secret is compromised.
      Anyone who cloned the repo may have it cached.
```

### Commit Signing

```bash
# GPG signing setup
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
git config --global tag.gpgsign true

# SSH signing (GitHub, simpler)
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Verify signed commits
git log --show-signature
```

### .gitignore Best Practices

```yaml
gitignore_checklist:
  always_ignore:
    - "node_modules/ / venv/ / __pycache__/"
    - ".env / .env.local / .env.*.local"
    - "*.key / *.pem / *.p12"
    - ".DS_Store / Thumbs.db"
    - "*.log / logs/"
    - "dist/ / build/ / out/"
    - "coverage/ / .nyc_output/"
    - ".idea/ / .vscode/ (except shared settings)"
    - "*.sqlite / *.db (unless intentional)"
  never_ignore:
    - ".gitignore itself"
    - "lockfiles (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml)"
    - ".env.example (template without secrets)"
    - "docker-compose.yml"
    - "Makefile / Taskfile"
  template: "Use github.com/github/gitignore as base"
```

---

## Phase 8: Git Workflows for Common Scenarios

### Feature Development (GitHub Flow)

```yaml
feature_workflow:
  steps:
    1_branch: "git checkout -b feat/PROJ-123-description main"
    2_develop:
      - "Make atomic commits following conventional commits"
      - "Push regularly (at least daily)"
      - "Keep rebased on main: git rebase main"
    3_pr:
      - "Open PR early as draft for visibility"
      - "Convert to ready when tests pass"
      - "Request reviewers via CODEOWNERS"
    4_review:
      - "Address feedback in new commits (don't force-push during review)"
      - "Re-request review after changes"
    5_merge:
      - "Squash merge for clean history"
      - "Delete branch after merge (automated)"
    6_deploy:
      - "CI/CD deploys from main automatically"
```

### Trunk-Based Development

```yaml
trunk_based:
  rules:
    - "All developers commit to main (or short-lived branches <1 day)"
    - "Feature flags gate incomplete features"
    - "No long-lived branches (ever)"
    - "Broken main = stop everything, fix immediately"
    - "Pair programming reduces need for PR reviews"
  short_lived_branches:
    max_lifetime: "1 day"
    merge_strategy: "squash"
    review: "Optional for small changes, required for >50 LOC"
  prerequisites:
    - "Comprehensive CI pipeline (<10 min)"
    - "Feature flag infrastructure"
    - "High test coverage (>80%)"
    - "Trunk-based CI (main always deployable)"
    - "Strong automated testing culture"
```

### Database Migration Workflow

```yaml
migration_workflow:
  rules:
    - "One migration per PR (never batch)"
    - "Migrations are forward-only (no down migrations in production)"
    - "Every migration must be backward compatible"
    - "Test migration against production data clone"
  backward_compatible_patterns:
    add_column: "Add with default value, make nullable initially"
    rename_column: "Add new → migrate data → update code → drop old (3 PRs)"
    remove_column: "Stop reading → stop writing → drop (2 PRs)"
    add_index: "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY"
    change_type: "Add new column → migrate → swap → drop old"
  review:
    required_reviewers: ["dba", "senior-backend"]
    extra_checks:
      - "Migration runs in <30 seconds"
      - "No table locks on large tables"
      - "Rollback tested"
```

### Dependency Update Workflow

```yaml
dependency_updates:
  automation:
    tool: "Dependabot / Renovate"
    config:
      schedule: "weekly"
      group_by: "update-type"
      automerge:
        - "patch updates (tests pass)"
        - "minor updates (for low-risk deps)"
      manual_review:
        - "major updates"
        - "security-sensitive packages"

  renovate_config:
    # renovate.json
    extends: ["config:recommended"]
    schedule: ["before 9am on Monday"]
    automerge: true
    automergeType: "pr"
    packageRules:

## Phase 9: Git Performance & Large Repos

### Performance Optimization

| Problem | Solution | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Slow clone | `git clone --depth 1` (shallow) | 10-100x faster |
| Large repo | `git sparse-checkout` | Clone only needed dirs |
| Slow fetch | `git fetch --prune --tags` | Remove stale refs |
| Large files | Git LFS | Keep repo size manageable |
| Slow status | `git config core.fsmonitor true` | 2-5x faster on large repos |
| Slow diff | `git config diff.algorithm histogram` | Better diff quality |
| Many branches | Auto-delete merged branches | Keep ref count low |

### Git LFS Setup

```yaml
git_lfs:
  when_to_use:
    - "Binary files >1MB (images, videos, models)"
    - "Generated files that change frequently"
    - "Design assets (PSD, Sketch, Figma exports)"
  never_lfs:
    - "Source code"
    - "Configuration files"
    - "Small images (<100KB)"
  setup: |
    git lfs install
    git lfs track "*.psd"
    git lfs track "*.zip"
    git lfs track "models/**"
    git add .gitattributes
  cost_warning: |
    GitHub LFS: 1GB free, then $5/50GB/month
    Consider alternatives for very large assets:
    - S3/GCS with download scripts
    - DVC (Data Version Control) for ML
    - Git Annex for large media
```

### Sparse Checkout for Monorepos

```bash
# Clone only what you need
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/org/monorepo.git
cd monorepo
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set apps/my-app packages/shared

# Add more directories later
git sparse-checkout add packages/another-lib
```

## Phase 10: Git Troubleshooting & Recovery

### Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem | Command | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Undo last commit (keep changes) | `git reset --soft HEAD~1` | Staged, ready to recommit |
| Undo last commit (discard) | `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | ⚠️ Destructive |
| Find lost commit | `git reflog` | Reflog keeps 90 days |
| Recover deleted branch | `git reflog` → `git checkout -b branch <sha>` | Find the SHA in reflog |
| Remove file from all history | `git filter-repo --path file --invert-paths` | Requires force push |
| Fix wrong branch | `git stash` → `git checkout correct` → `git stash pop` | |
| Resolve merge conflict | `git mergetool` or manual edit | Accept theirs: `git checkout --theirs file` |
| Bisect to find bug | `git bisect start` → `git bisect bad` → `git bisect good <sha>` | Binary search |
| Squash last N commits | `git rebase -i HEAD~N` | Mark as squash/fixup |
| Amend last commit message | `git commit --amend` | Only if not pushed |

### Emergency Procedures

```yaml
emergency_procedures:
  secrets_in_repo:
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    steps:
      1: "Revoke credential IMMEDIATELY (don't wait for history clean)"
      2: "Remove with git filter-repo"
      3: "Force push all branches"
      4: "Contact GitHub support to clear caches"
      5: "Audit credential usage"
      6: "Add to pre-commit hooks"

  broken_main:
    severity: "HIGH"
    steps:
      1: "Revert the breaking commit: git revert <sha>"
      2: "Push revert immediately"
      3: "Investigate in separate branch"
      4: "Fix forward (don't revert the revert)"

  accidental_force_push:
    severity: "HIGH"
    steps:
      1: "Check reflog for the previous HEAD"
      2: "Reset to previous state"
      3: "Force push the recovery"
      4: "Notify team to re-pull"
      5: "Add branch protection to prevent recurrence"

  repo_too_large:
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    steps:
      1: "Identify large files: git rev-list --objects --all | git cat-file --batch-check"
      2: "Move large files to LFS: git lfs migrate import --include='*.zip'"
      3: "Or remove with filter-repo"
      4: "Force push cleaned history"
      5: "Team re-clones"
```

## Phase 11: Advanced Patterns

### Git Hooks Architecture

```yaml
git_hooks:
  tool: "husky (JS) / pre-commit (Python) / lefthook (any)"
  recommended_hooks:
    pre_commit:
      - lint-staged (format only changed files)
      - commitlint (conventional commit check)
      - gitleaks (secrets scan)
    commit_msg:
      - commitlint --edit $1
    pre_push:
      - type-check
      - unit tests (fast subset)
    prepare_commit_msg:
      - Add branch ticket number to commit

  lefthook_config: |
    # lefthook.yml
    pre-commit:
      parallel: true
      commands:
        lint:
          glob: "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
          run: npx eslint {staged_files}
        format:
          glob: "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md}"
          run: npx prettier --check {staged_files}
        secrets:
          run: gitleaks protect --staged

    commit-msg:
      commands:
        lint-commit:
          run: npx commitlint --edit {1}
```

### Worktrees for Parallel Development

```bash
# Work on hotfix while feature branch is open
git worktree add ../hotfix-workspace hotfix/PROJ-789
cd ../hotfix-workspace
# Fix, commit, push — without touching main workspace
git worktree remove ../hotfix-workspace

# Use cases:
# - Reviewing PR while working on feature
# - Running tests on one branch while coding on another
# - Comparing behavior between branches
```

### Git Subtree for Shared Libraries

```bash
# Add shared library
git subtree add --prefix=libs/shared https://github.com/org/shared.git main --squash

# Pull updates
git subtree pull --prefix=libs/shared https://github.com/org/shared.git main --squash

# Push changes back
git subtree push --prefix=libs/shared https://github.com/org/shared.git feature-branch

# When to use subtree vs submodule:
# Subtree: simpler, code lives in your repo, no extra clone steps
# Submodule: pointer to external repo, separate versioning, requires init
```

### Changelog Generation

```yaml
changelog_tools:
  conventional_changelog:
    command: "npx conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s"
    output: "Groups by feat/fix/perf with commit links"

  git_cliff:
    command: "git cliff --output CHANGELOG.md"
    config: |
      # cliff.toml
      [changelog]
      header = "# Changelog\n"
      body = """
      ## [{{ version }}] - {{ timestamp | date(format="%Y-%m-%d") }}
      {% for group, commits in commits | group_by(attribute="group") %}
      ### {{ group }}
      {% for commit in commits %}
      - {{ commit.message }} ([{{ commit.id | truncate(length=7) }}]({{ commit.id }}))
      {% endfor %}
      {% endfor %}
      """
      trim = true

  release_please:
    approach: "Creates PR with changelog + version bump"
    config: |
      {
        "release-type": "node",
        "packages": { ".": {} }
      }
```

## 10 Git Engineering Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Fix |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Committing secrets | Pre-commit hooks (gitleaks) + CI scan |
| 2 | Long-lived branches | Max 5-day policy, split large features |
| 3 | Merge commits everywhere | Squash merge or rebase, linear history |
| 4 | No branch protection | Enforce reviews + status checks |
| 5 | Giant PRs (>500 lines) | Split by concern, stacked PRs |
| 6 | Force pushing shared branches | Never force push main/develop |
| 7 | No CI before merge | Block merge without passing checks |
| 8 | Manual releases | Automate with semantic-release/release-please |
| 9 | Ignoring git history | Conventional commits, meaningful messages |
| 10 | No CODEOWNERS | Define ownership for review routing |

---

## Edge Cases

### Startup / Solo Developer
- Start with GitHub Flow (simplest)
- Use conventional commits from day 1
- Set up pre-commit hooks immediately
- Branch protection even on solo repos (prevents accidents)

### Large Enterprise (>100 devs)
- Trunk-Based Development with feature flags
- Monorepo with Bazel/Nx + remote caching
- CODEOWNERS for every directory
- Automated everything (lint, test, release, changelog)

### Open Source Project
- Require signed commits from maintainers
- Fork-based workflow for external contributors
- DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) or CLA
- Protected main + develop branches
- Issue templates + PR templates mandatory

### Migration from SVN/Perforce
- Use `git svn` or `git p4` for initial migration
- Preserve history where possible
- Retrain team on branching (it's cheap in git!)
- Start with GitHub Flow, graduate to trunk-based

### Regulated Industry (SOX/HIPAA/PCI)
- Signed commits mandatory
- PR approval from compliance-aware reviewer
- Audit trail: never squash (keep individual commits)
- Branch protection: no admin override
- Tag every production release
