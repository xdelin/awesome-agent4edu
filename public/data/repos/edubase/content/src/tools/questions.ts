# Questions (Lowest Level in EduBase Hierarchy)

Questions are the atomic building blocks of the EduBase Quiz system.
They represent the lowest level in the EduBase hierarchy, below both Quiz sets and Exams.

Key characteristics:
- Questions have various types (choice, numerical, expression, text, etc.)
- They can be parametrized for dynamic content generation
- Questions are stored in QuestionBase or directly in Quiz sets
- Questions cannot exist directly in Exams without being part of a Quiz set
- Questions can use LaTeX for displaying mathematical notation (NEVER use single dollar signs $...$)
