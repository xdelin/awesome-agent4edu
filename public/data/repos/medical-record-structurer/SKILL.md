# Medical Record Structurer

> **Version**: 1.0.4  
> **Category**: Healthcare / Medical  
> **Billing**: SkillPay (0.001 USDT per call)  
> **Free Trial**: 10 free calls per user

A professional medical record processing tool that transforms unstructured medical notes (voice or text) into standardized electronic medical records.

## Features

1. **Voice/Text Input Processing** - Accepts doctor's口述 or handwritten notes
2. **AI-Powered Field Extraction** - Automatically identifies and extracts medical fields
3. **Standardized EMR Output** - Generates structured electronic medical records
4. **Payment Integration** - skillpay.me integration for monetization (0.001 USDT per use)
5. **Free Trial** - 10 free calls for every new user

## Free Trial

Each user gets **10 free calls** before billing begins. During the trial:
- No payment required
- Full feature access
- Trial status returned in API response

```python
{
    "success": True,
    "trial_mode": True,      # Currently in free trial
    "trial_remaining": 5,    # 5 free calls left
    "balance": None,         # No balance needed in trial
    "structured_record": {...}
}
```

After 10 free calls, normal billing applies.

## Quick Start

### Process a medical record:

```python
from scripts.process_record import process_medical_record
import os

# Set API key via environment variable (only needed after trial)
os.environ["SKILLPAY_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

# Process with user_id for billing/trial tracking
result = process_medical_record(
    input_text="患者张三，男，45岁，主诉头痛3天...",
    user_id="user_123"
)

# Check result
if result["success"]:
    print("结构化病历:", result["structured_record"])
    if result.get("trial_mode"):
        print(f"免费试用剩余: {result['trial_remaining']} 次")
    else:
        print("剩余余额:", result["balance"])
else:
    print("错误:", result["error"])
    if "paymentUrl" in result:
        print("充值链接:", result["paymentUrl"])
```

### API Usage:

```bash
# Set API key via environment variable (only needed after trial)
export SKILLPAY_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run with user_id for billing/trial tracking
python scripts/process_record.py \
  --input "患者张三，男，45岁，主诉头痛3天..." \
  --user-id "user_123"
```

    "trial_remaining": 0,       # Remaining free calls
    "balance": 95.5,            # User balance (None during trial)
    "structured_record": {
        "emr_version": "1.0",
        "record_id": "EMR_20240306120000",
        "record_date": "2024-03-06T12:00:00",

## PHI and Privacy Handling

This skill processes Protected Health Information (PHI). The following safeguards are implemented:

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: User authentication required for all operations
- **Audit Logging**: All access to PHI is logged
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary fields are extracted and stored

### Compliance
- **HIPAA Considerations**: Designed with HIPAA safeguards in mind
- **GDPR**: Supports data deletion requests
- **Retention**: Configurable data retention policies (default: 30 days)

### Best Practices
1. Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
2. Enable audit logging in production
3. Implement proper access controls
4. Regular security reviews recommended

## OCR/STT Support

This skill supports external OCR and STT services:

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
For processing handwritten or scanned medical records:
- Google Vision API
- Azure Computer Vision
- AWS Textract
- Tesseract (open source)

### STT (Speech-to-Text)
